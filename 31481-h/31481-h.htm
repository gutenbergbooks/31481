<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>&nbsp;firmly</span> believe that the following tales
have never seen the light of publicity.
They are the folklore of Spain and Portugal.</p>

<p>Since the day when Hernando del Castillo,
in 1511, published some of the romances of
Spanish chivalry collected from the people,
various works have appeared at different times,
adding to the already rich store from that
inexhaustible mine of song and story.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately for those who appreciate
originality in a people, it was discovered that
Boccaccio had been most unceremoniously
plagiarized, and, what was still worse, that his
defects had not been avoided.</p>

<p>The “Decameron” has, in fact, been the
foundation of the majority of the romances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>attributed to the natives of the Peninsula when,
as has too often been the case, they have in
their songs of chivalry overstepped the limits
imposed by decorum.</p>

<p>But this does not argue that the Spaniards
and Portuguese have no poetry and no folklore
of their own, but rather that the latter have
been ignored by the compilers of such literature,
in order to satisfy the cravings of the
unfortunately too many admirers, even in this
day, of that which would have been of advantage
to the world at large had it never been
imagined.</p>

<p>In England the tale of “Jack the Giant
Killer” is read with avidity by all young people,
for it is a purely national tale; but in Spain
and Portugal such simple tales very seldom
find a publisher, and children, and even their
elders have to content themselves with hearing
them recited by those who enliven the long
wintry nights with such lore as I have
attempted to reproduce from my memory,
told me in my youth in the bosom of those
two sister lands which produced the Cid
Campeador and the Gran Vasco da Gama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>And, before closing this preface, I would
remark that the North of Portugal, where I
was born and bred, is richer in folklore than
the rest of the kingdom, especially in tales
about enchanted Moors and warlocks, of whom
I, in common with the Portuguese, say,
“Abernuncio.”</p>

<h2><a name="The_Ingenious_Student" id="The_Ingenious_Student"></a><i>THE INGENIOUS STUDENT.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was once a student in Tuy who
was so very poor that, if faith in Providence
be not reckoned, he possessed no riches.</p>

<p>But Juan Rivas was endowed with a wonderfully
fine gift of ingenuity, and although he
was somewhat behind in the payment for the
Masses on behalf of his predecessors, and even
more so with his mundane creditors, still was
he a man who meant well and would do the
right thing if he only had the opportunity.</p>

<p>To the man of the world there is no greater
pleasure than to pay his debts, for by so doing
he increases his credit.</p>

<p>Juan Rivas would willingly have paid every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>creditor had his pocket been as full of the
wherewithal as his heart was of gratitude for
small mercies; but there is no difficulty about
showing one’s self desirous of satisfying one’s
debts&mdash;the only difficulty generally rests in
being able to do so.</p>

<p>At college he had proved himself a good
scholar and a true companion; but as he could
no longer contribute toward the support of his
college, his college could not be expected to
support him.</p>

<p>His long black cap, his flowing robes, his
pantaloons, and his shoes were altered in substance,
and so was Juan Rivas.</p>

<p>Finally he became reduced to his last maravedi,
and as his friends could no longer assist
him, he thought it was high time he should
assist himself.</p>

<p>“Providence,” said he, “has never intended
me for a poor man, but Fate has almost made
me one. I will believe in Providence, and
become rich from this day.” Saying which, he
went to some of his companions, who were
almost as poor as he was, and asked them if
they desired to be rich.</p>

<p>“Do you ask us if we want to be rich with
so serious a face?” answered they. “Really,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>friend Juan, you are so strange that you do not
seem to belong to this city!”</p>

<p>“No man can be rich,” continued Juan, “by
staying at home. We are students, and our
studies should meet with some recompense.
Will you do as I bid you?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried all his poor companions; “so
long as you lead us not to the gallows, for we
like not such playthings.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, follow me,” said Juan; “and
when you see me release a prize that belongs
to him who shall be bold enough to seize it,
off with it to the market, and dispose of it at
the best possible price.”</p>

<p>“Done, and agreed to,” shouted all, “if
you will but seize the prize!”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me,” said the poor student,
“and I will hand you a prize fully worth
twenty dollars without his garments.”</p>

<p>“But, surely, you are not going to hand some
man or woman over to us?” inquired they.</p>

<p>“Ask me no questions, as the Archbishop of
Compostella said to the pretty widow, and I
will be honest with you. The prize I shall
hand you will fetch money in the market, and
we sell not human beings in this country,”
urged Juan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>“That is right,” they exclaimed; “and we
will follow you.”</p>

<p>The students followed Juan on to the high-road
leading from the city to Ourense; and
when they had walked for about two hours’
time Juan told his companions to get behind
the hedge and await results.</p>

<p>Soon after, the jingling of bells was heard,
and a muleteer seated cross-legged on a mule,
which preceded five others, was seen approaching.</p>

<p>As the muleteer had sold all his wares he
was indulging in a sleep, and had it not been
for the dog-flies that teased the mules they
would also have slept.</p>

<p>Juan let the muleteer pass; but as the last
mule came up he seized it, and, taking off its
trappings, and disencumbering it of its ponderous
albarda, or saddle, he freed the animal on
the roadside, and replaced the trappings and
the saddle on himself.</p>

<p>His companions were not slow in seizing the
prize and hurrying away with it, while Juan
Rivas continued for some distance along the
road, following in the train of mules.</p>

<p>As soon as he considered that his companions
would be out of sight, he commenced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>backing with all his strength, which brought
the mules to a sudden halt and caused their
bells to tinkle.</p>

<p>The muleteer looked back to see if anything
was wrong, but, perceiving nothing, bestowed a
hearty blow on his mule, and on he went again.</p>

<p>The student now began to rear and jump
about so that the muleteer pulled up, and,
having dismounted, proceeded to inquire into
the cause of the mule so misbehaving itself;
but his astonishment was great when, instead
of a mule, he saw a human being bearing the
trappings and the saddle.</p>

<p>“What merry freak is this,” demanded the
muleteer, addressing the student, “that I see
you replacing my mule?”</p>

<p>“It is no merry freak, indeed it is not,”
replied Juan Rivas, “but a sad reality. You
see before you, good master, a poor, miserable
creature, who for his many offences against
Mother Church was transformed into a mule,
and sentenced to remain so for a number of
years. My term of punishment has just expired,
and I am restored to my natural form.”</p>

<p>“But where is my mule that cost me one
hundred crowns not many years ago?” asked
the muleteer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>“You do not understand me, good master,”
replied the student. “I was the mule, and the
mule was I; now I am I. When you used to
kick your mule, you really kicked me; when
you fed it, you fed me; and now, when you
speak to me, you speak to all that remains of
your mule. Now do you understand?”</p>

<p>“I am beginning to perceive,” said the muleteer,
scratching his head and looking very
sorrowful, “that for your sins you were turned
into a mule, and that for mine, I had the misfortune
to purchase you. I always thought
there was something strange about that mule!”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt that we all must put up
with the consequences of our evil ways, and, as
you very properly say, you have been punished
by the loss of your mule; but, then, you can
rejoice with me, seeing that the son of the first
Grandee in Spain served you in the humble
capacity of a beast of burden, and now is restored
to rank and wealth.”</p>

<p>“And are you a Grandee of Spain?”
anxiously inquired the poor man, “Why,
then, your excellency will never forgive me for
the many kicks I have bestowed on your excellency’s
sides; and I am a ruined man, for
you will have me punished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>“Not so, kind friend; not so,” replied the
student, in an assuring tone; “for how could
you tell that your mule was not a mule?”</p>

<p>“Then your excellency will not be revenged
on me?” continued the muleteer. “And if it
will be of any consolation to your excellency,
I promise never to divulge this mystery!”</p>

<p>“It will, indeed, be a great comfort to me
to think that no one will know what became of
me for so many years,” replied the student.
“And now I must bid you good-bye, for I am
in a hurry to again embrace my dear parents if
they be still living.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said the muleteer, with emotion;
“and may your excellency never again incur
the displeasure of Mother Church.”</p>

<p>Thus they parted good friends; the muleteer
pondering over what he termed the mysteries
of life, and Juan Rivas full of delight at the
thought of rejoining his companions, and having
a good supper with the proceeds of the mule,
which pleasure was not denied him and his
friends.</p>

<p>In a fortnight’s time there was a cattle fair
in the neighbourhood of Tuy, and as the muleteer
required to replace the mule he had so
mysteriously lost, he attended the fair, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>looking about him for a serviceable mule, when
an acquaintance called out to him to know why
he had parted with the other one.</p>

<p>“I have my private reasons,” answered the
muleteer, “and I am not here to let you know
them.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” continued his inquisitive friend;
“but the proverb says that ‘the mule you
know is better than the mule you don’t know,’
and if you will take my advice, you will buy your
old mule back again, for there it is”&mdash;pointing
to it.</p>

<p>The muleteer looked in the direction mentioned,
and was horrified at seeing his late mule
again; but, trying to conceal his emotion, he
approached the animal and whispered in its
ear, “Those who don’t know what sort of a
mule your excellency is may buy you, but I
know the mule you are;” and, turning away, he
sorrowfully exclaimed, “He has again offended.
Terrible are the judgments of Providence!”</p>

<h2><a name="The_Ugly_Princess" id="The_Ugly_Princess"></a><i>THE UGLY PRINCESS.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was once a king who had an only
daughter, and she was so very ugly and
deformed that, when she rode through the
streets of Alcantara, the children ran away,
thinking she was a witch.</p>

<p>Her father, however, thought her the most
lovely creature in his kingdom; and as all the
courtiers agreed with him, and the Court poet
was always singing her praises, the princess
had been led to believe what most ladies like
to believe; and as she was expecting a prince
from a distant country, who was coming expressly
to marry her, she had ordered many
rich dresses which only made her look uglier.</p>

<p>The city of Alcantara was ready to receive
Prince Alanbam, who was going to espouse the
Princess Altamira.</p>

<p>Crowds thronged the streets, martial music
was heard everywhere, and in the public square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>a splendid throne had been erected for the
king, Princess Altamira, and Prince Alanbam.</p>

<p>Around the throne were formed large bodies
of well-equipped cavalry, dark visaged warriors
clad in white and gold, and mounted on superb
Arab steeds.</p>

<p>Behind the king, on his left side, stood the
royal barber with his retinue of apprentices;
and on his right side was seen Nabó the
headsman, a nigger of gigantic stature, with
his implement of office, an axe, over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Seated on the steps of the throne were a
number of musicians, and below these a guard
of honour, composed of foot soldiers dressed in
short vests, called “aljubas,” and wide lower
garments, and with their aljavas, or quivers,
full of bright arrows.</p>

<p>From the throne the king could see the
splendid bridge on six pillars, built by Trajan,
along which a brilliant cavalcade was proceeding,
namely, the procession formed by Prince
Alanbam and his retainers.</p>

<p>As soon as the prince, after saluting the
king, beheld the princess, he turned pale, for
he had never seen any one so ugly; and however
much he might have desired to keep up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>an appearance of courtesy to the princess before
her father’s subjects, he could not kiss her as
she expected him to do, nor could he be persuaded
to occupy the chair reserved for him
beside the princess.</p>

<p>“Your mercy,” said he, addressing the king,
“must excuse my insuperable bashfulness; but
the fact is that the Princess Altamira is so
transcendently beautiful, and so dazzling to
behold, that I can never expect to look upon
her face again and live.”</p>

<p>The king and the princess were highly
flattered; but as Prince Alanbam continued
obdurate in his professions of bashfulness, they
commenced to feel somewhat vexed, and at
last the king said in a loud voice&mdash;</p>

<p>“Prince Alanbam, we fully appreciate the
motive that prompts your conduct, but the
fact is the Princess Altamira is present to be
wedded to you; and, as a Christian king, the
first of my line, I desire to lead to the altar
my only daughter, Princess Altamira, and her
affianced husband, Prince Alanbam.”</p>

<p>“It cannot be,” said the prince. “I would
rather marry some one less beautiful. Sir
king, forgive me if I annoy you, but I will not
be wedded to so much beauty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>The king was now incensed beyond measure,
and the princess his daughter, thinking to spite
Prince Alanbam, said&mdash;</p>

<p>“With your permission, royal father, since I
am too beautiful for a prince, I will be married
to the most learned man in your kingdom&mdash;Bernardo,
the royal barber.”</p>

<p>“And that you shall,” said the king; but, on
turning round to speak to the barber, he found
that this the most learned man in his kingdom
was all of a tremble, as if dancing to the music
of St. Vitus.</p>

<p>“What has possessed thee, caitiff?” asked
the king. “Hearest not thou the honour that
is to be conferred on thee?”</p>

<p>“My royal master,” muttered the poor
frightened man of learning and lather, “I can
no more avail myself of the honour which
you would confer on me than the Archbishop
of Villafranca could. His grace is bound to
celibacy, and I am already married.”</p>

<p>Now, the barber had on many occasions
rendered himself obnoxious to Sanchez, the
royal cobbler, who, seeing the king’s perplexity,
and a chance of avenging past insults, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Royal master, it would be most acceptable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>to your subjects that so much beauty should be
wedded to so much learning. Our good friend,
Bernardo, was, it is true, married; but since he
has been in attendance at the palace, he has so
fallen in love with Princess Altamira that he no
longer notices his wife; therefore, may it please
your mercy to dissolve the first marriage, and
announce this new one with her highness, your
daughter?”</p>

<p>The barber at this harangue became so
infuriated that he rushed blindly at the cobbler,
and with his razor would have severed his
head from the rest of his body, but that he
was prevented by the guard, who held him
down.</p>

<p>“Executioner, do your work!” cried the
baffled king; and at one blow the head of the
unfortunate barber rolled on the ground.</p>

<p>Prince Alanbam seeing this, and fearing that
more mischief might ensue, proposed to the
king that one hundred knights should be chosen,
and that these should fight for the hand of the
lovely Princess Altamira. “I myself will enter
the lists,” said the prince; “and the survivor
will be rewarded by marrying your daughter.”</p>

<p>“That is a good idea,” said the king; and
calling together ninety-nine of his best knights,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>he bade them fight valiantly, for their reward
was very precious.</p>

<p>Fifty knights, mounted on beautiful chargers,
placed themselves on one side, and were
opposed by forty-nine equally well-mounted
knights and Prince Alanbam; and at the word
of command, given by the king, they advanced
at headlong speed against each other; but,
much to the astonishment of the spectators, no
knight was unhorsed; rather did it seem that
each knight did his utmost to get run through
by his opponent.</p>

<p>At it they went again and again, but with
the same result, for no man was hurt, although
seeming to court death.</p>

<p>“We will alter the order of things,” exclaimed
the king. “The knight who is first
wounded shall be the one to marry the
princess.”</p>

<p>This was no sooner said than the knights
seemed to be possessed of a blind fury, and
at the first charge nearly every knight was
unhorsed and every one wounded, while the
confusion and noise were awful. They were
all accusing each other of being the first
wounded; so that, in utter despair, the king
declared his daughter should be married to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Church, enter a convent, and thus hide her
transcendent beauty.</p>

<p>“No, father,” exclaimed the ugly princess;
“I will get a husband; and if in all the states
of Spain no one be found worthy enough to
be my husband, I will leave Spain for ever.
There is a country where the day never dawns,
and night is eternal. Thither will I go; for in
the dark, as all cats are gray, so are all degrees
of beauty brought to one common level. I
now know that it is just as unfortunate to be
too beautiful as it is to be very ugly.”</p>

<p>Having delivered herself of this speech,
Princess Altamira bade the king, her father,
good-bye, and was on the point of leaving the
royal presence, when the handsome figure of
Felisberto, the blind fiddler, was seen to
approach.</p>

<p>“Princess,” exclaimed blind Felisberto, “to
Spain nothing is denied. You speak of proceeding
to the North, where the day never
dawns, in search of a husband. You need but
look at me to behold one to whom night
and day, extreme ugliness and transcendent
beauty, are alike; and since all are so bashful
that they will not marry you, allow me, fair
princess, to offer you my services as a husband.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>In my world ‘handsome is that handsome
does.’”</p>

<p>The king was so pleased with the blind
fiddler’s speech that he immediately made him
a Grandee of Spain, and acknowledged him as
his son-in-law elect.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Wolf-Child" id="The_Wolf-Child"></a><i>THE WOLF-CHILD.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the North of Portugal there are many
sequestered spots where the enchanted
Moors and the wizards meet when it is full
moon. These places are generally situated
among high rocks on the precipitous sides of
the hills overlooking rivers; and when the wind
is very boisterous their terrible screams and
incantations can be distinctly heard by the
peasantry inhabiting the neighbouring villages.</p>

<p>On such occasions the father of the family
sets fire to a wisp of straw, and with it makes
the sign of the cross around his house, which
prevents these evil spirits from approaching.
The other members of the family place a few
extra lights before the image of the Virgin; and
the horse-shoe nailed to the door completes the
safety of the house.</p>

<p>But it will so happen that sometimes an
enchanted Moor, with more cunning than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>honesty, will get through one of the windows
on the birth of a child, and will brand the
infant with the crescent on his shoulder or
arm, in which case it is well known that the
child, on certain nights, will be changed into
a wolf.</p>

<p>The enchanted Moors have their castles and
palaces under the ground or beneath the rivers,
and they wander about the earth, seeing but
not seen; for they died unbaptized, and have,
therefore, no rest in the grave.</p>

<p>They seem to have given preference to the
North of Portugal, where they are held in
great fear by the ignorant peasantry; and it
has been observed that all such of the natives
as have left their homes to study at the universities,
on their return have never been
visited by the enchanted Moors, as it is well
known that they have a great respect for
learning. In fact, one of the kings has said
that until all his subjects were educated they
would never get rid of the enchanted Moors
and wizards.</p>

<p>In a village called Darque, on the banks of
the Lima, there lived a farmer whose goodness
and ignorance were only equalled by those of
his wife. They were both young and robust,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>and were sufficiently well off to afford the
luxury of beef once or twice a month. Their
clothes were home-spun, and their hearts were
homely. Beyond their landlord’s grounds they
had never stepped; but as he owned nearly
the whole village, it is very evident that they
knew something of this world of ours. They
were both born and married on the estate, as
their parents had been before them, and they
were contented because they had never mixed
with the world.</p>

<p>One day, when the farmer came home to
have his midday meal of broth and maize
bread, he found his wife in bed with a newborn
baby boy by her side, and he was so
pleased that he spent his hour of rest looking
at the child, so that his meal remained untasted
on the table.</p>

<p>Kissing his wife and infant, and bidding her
beware of evil eyes, he hurried out of the house
back to his work; and so great was his joy at
being a father that he did not feel hungry.</p>

<p>He was digging potatoes, and in his excitement
had sent his hoe through some of them,
which, however, he did not notice until he
happened to strike one that was so hard that
the steel of his hoe flashed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Thinking it was a pebble, he stooped to
pick it up, but was surprised to see that it was
no longer there.</p>

<p>However, he went on working, when he
struck another hard potato, and his hoe again
flashed.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said he, “the evil one has been sowing
this field with stones, as he did in the days of
good Saint Euphemia, our patroness.” Saying
which, he drew out the small crucifix from
under his shirt, and the flinty potato disappeared;
but he noticed that one of its eyes
moved.</p>

<p>He thought no more of this untoward event,
and went on hoeing until sunset, when, with
the other labourers, he shouldered his hoe and
prepared to go home.</p>

<p>Never had the distance seemed so great;
but at last he found himself by his wife’s bedside.
She told him that while he was absent
an old woman had called, asking for something
to eat, and that as she seemed to have met
with some accident, because there was blood
running down her face, she invited her in,
and told her she might eat what her husband
had left untasted.</p>

<p>Sitting down at the table, the old woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>commenced eating without asking a blessing
on the food; and when she had finished she
approached the bed, and, looking at the infant,
she muttered some words and left the house
hurriedly.</p>

<p>The husband and wife were very much
afraid that the old woman was a witch; but as
the child went on growing and seemed well
they gradually forgot their visitor.</p>

<p>The infant was baptized, and was named
John; and when he was old enough he was
sent out to work to help his parents. All the
labourers noticed that John could get through
more work than any man, he was so strong
and active; but he was very silent.</p>

<p>The remarkable strength of the boy got to
be so spoken about in the village that at last
the wise woman, who was always consulted,
said that there was no doubt but that John was
a wolf-child; and this having come to the ears
of his parents, his body was carefully examined,
and the mark of the crescent was found under
his arm.</p>

<p>Nothing now remained to be done but to
take John to the great wise woman of Arifana,
and have him disenchanted.</p>

<p>The day had arrived for the parents to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>John with them to Arifana, but when they
looked for him he could nowhere be found.
They searched everywhere&mdash;down the well, in
the river, in the forest&mdash;and made inquiries at
all the villages, but in vain; John had disappeared.</p>

<p>Weeks went by without any sign of him;
and the winter having set in, the wolves,
through hunger, had become more undaunted
in their attacks on the flocks and herds. The
farmer, afraid of firing at them, lest he might
shoot his son, had laid a trap; and one morning,
to his delight, he saw that a very large
wolf had been caught, which one of his fellow-labourers
was cudgelling. Fearing it might be
the lost wolf-child, he hastened to the spot,
and prevented the wolf receiving more blows;
but it was too late, apparently, to save the
creature’s life, for it lay motionless on the
ground as if dead. Hurrying off for the wise
woman of the village, she returned with him;
and, close to the head of the wolf, she gathered
some branches of the common pine-tree, and
lighting them, as some were green and others
dry, a volume of smoke arose like a tower,
reaching to the top of a hill where lived some
notorious enchanted Moors and wizards; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>that between the wolf and the said Moors the
distance was covered by a tunnel of smoke and
fire. Then the wise woman intoned the following
words, closing her eyes, and bidding the
rest do so until she should tell them they might
open them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Spirit of the mighty wind<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That across the desert howls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help us here to unbind<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All the spells of dreaded ghouls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the path of smoke and fire<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rising to the wizards’ mound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid the cursèd mark retire<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From this creature on the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid him take his shape again,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Free him from the Crescent’s power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May the holy Cross remain<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On his temple from this hour.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She now made the sign of the Cross over the
head of the wolf, and continued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“River, winding to the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Stay thy rippling current, stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jordan’s stream thy tide has blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Help us wash this stain away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear it to the ocean wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Back to Saracenic shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who washed in thee have died<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But to live for evermore.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then she sprinkled a few drops over the fire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>which caused a larger amount of smoke, and
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hie thee, spirit, up through smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Quenched by water and by fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hie thee far from Christian folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the wizard’s home retire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Open wide your eyelids now,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All the smoke has curled away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Neath the peaceful olive bough<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let us go, and let us pray.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then they all rose, and the wolf was no
longer there. The fire had burned itself out,
and the stream was again running. In slow
procession they went to the olive grotto,
headed by the wise woman; and, after praying,
they returned to the house, where they
found, to their delight, John fast asleep in his
bed; but his arms showed signs of bruises
which had been caused by the cudgelling he
had received when he was caught in the trap.</p>

<p>There were great rejoicings that day in the
village of Darque; and no one was better
pleased than John at having regained his proper
shape.</p>

<p>He was never known to join in the inhuman
sport of hunting wolves for pleasure, because,
as he said, although they may not be wolf-children,
they do but obey an instinct which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>was given them; and to be kind-hearted is to
obey a precept which was given us. And,
owing to the introduction into Portugal of the
Book in which this commandment is to be
found, wolf-children have become scarcer, and
the people wiser.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Magic_Mirror" id="The_Magic_Mirror"></a><i>THE MAGIC MIRROR.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was proclaimed throughout the kingdom
of Granada that the king had decided on
marrying. The news was first told to the
court barber, then to the night watchmen, and,
in the third place, to the oldest woman in the
city of Granada.</p>

<p>The barber told all his customers, who again
told all their friends. The night watchmen in
crying the hour proclaimed the news in a loud
voice, so that all the maidens were kept awake
by thinking of the news, and by day they
were being constantly reminded by all the old
dueñas that the king had resolved to marry.</p>

<p>After the news had become somewhat stale,
the question was asked, “Who is the king
going to marry?” To which the barber made
reply, that probably “he would marry a
woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>“A woman!” exclaimed his hearers. “Why,
what else could he marry?”</p>

<p>“Not all women are worthy the name,”
answered the barber. “Some more resemble
the unbaptized, of whom I say, <i>abernuncio</i>.”</p>

<p>“But what mean you, good friend?” demanded
his customers. “Is not the king to
find a woman for wife in our land of Spain?”</p>

<p>“He would,” replied the barber, “with
greater ease find the reverse; but to find a
woman worthy to be his wife I shall have
great trouble.”</p>

<p>“What, <i>you?</i>” exclaimed all of them. “What
have you got to do with providing the king
with a wife?”</p>

<p>“I am under royal licence, remember,” said
he of the razor; “for I am the only man in
the kingdom permitted to rub the royal features.
I am the possessor of the magic mirror
also, into which if any woman not being
thoroughly good shall look, the blemishes on
her character will appear as so many spots on
its surface.”</p>

<p>“Is this one of the conditions?” asked all.</p>

<p>“This is the sole condition,” replied the
barber, placing his thumbs in the armholes of
his waistcoat and looking very wise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>“But is there no limit as to age?” they
again inquired.</p>

<p>“Any woman from eighteen years upwards
is eligible,” said the possessor of the mirror.</p>

<p>“Then you will have every woman in
Granada claiming the right to be queen!” all
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“But, first of all, they will have to justify
their claim, for I will not take any woman at her
word. No; she will have to gaze into the mirror
with me by her side,” continued the barber.</p>

<p>The sole condition imposed on those who
desired to become Queen of Granada was made
known, and was much ridiculed, as may naturally
be supposed; but, strange to say, no woman
applied to the barber to have a look into the
mirror.</p>

<p>Days and weeks went by, but the king was
no nearer getting a wife. Some generous ladies
would try and prevail on their lady friends to
make the trial, but none seemed ambitious of
the honour.</p>

<p>The king, be it known, was a very handsome
man, and was beloved by all his subjects for his
many virtues; therefore it was surprising that
none of the lovely ladies who attended court
should try to become his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Many excuses and explanations were given.
Some were already engaged to be married,
others professed themselves too proud to enter
the barber’s shop, while others assured their
friends that they had resolved on remaining
single.</p>

<p>The latter seem to have been cleverer in
their excuses, for it was soon observable that no
man in Granada would marry, assigning as a
reason for this that until the king was suited
they would not think of marrying; though the
real cause may have been due to the objection
of the ladies to look into the mirror.</p>

<p>The fathers of families were much annoyed
at the apparent want of female ambition in their
daughters, while the mothers were strangely
silent on the matter.</p>

<p>Every morning the king would ask the barber
if any young lady had ventured on looking
into the mirror; but the answer was always
the same&mdash;that many watched his shop to see
if others went there, but none had ventured in.</p>

<p>“Ah, Granada, Granada!” exclaimed the
king; “hast thou no daughter to offer thy
king? In this Alhambra did my predecessors
enjoy the company of their wives; and am I to
be denied this natural comfort?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>“Royal master,” said the barber, “in those
days the magic mirror was unknown and not
so much required. Men then only studied
the arts, but now is science added to their
studies.”</p>

<p>“You mean, then,” asked the king, “that an
increase in knowledge has done no good?”</p>

<p>“I mean more than that,” continued the
barber; “I mean that people are worse than
they used to be.”</p>

<p>“‘God is great!’ is what these walls proclaim;
to know is to be wise,” urged the king.</p>

<p>“Not always, sir,” said the barber; “for the
majority of men and women in the present know
too much and are not too wise, although some
deem them wise for being cunning. There is
as great a distance between wisdom and cunning
as there is between the heavens and the
earth.”</p>

<p>“Barber,” shouted the king, “thou shalt get
me a wife bright as the day, pure as dew, and
good as gold&mdash;one who shall not be afraid to
look into thy magic mirror!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” replied the barber, “the only magic
about my mirror is that which the evil consciences
of the ladies of Granada conjure up.
The simple shepherdess on the mountain side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>would brave the magic power of any mirror,
strong in the consciousness of innocence; but
would you marry such a lowly one?”</p>

<p>“Such a woman is worthy to be a queen, for
she is a pearl without price,” answered the
king. “Go, bid her come here; and, in the presence
of my assembled court, let the gentle
shepherdess look into the mirror, after thou
hast told her of the danger of so doing.”</p>

<p>The barber was not long in bringing the
shepherdess to court with him; and it having
been proclaimed throughout the city that the
trial was going to be made, the principal hall
was soon filled with all the grand ladies and
knights of the king’s household.</p>

<p>When the shepherdess entered the royal
presence she felt very shy at being surrounded
by so much grandeur; but she knew enough
about her own sex to understand that they
inwardly considered her not quite so ugly as
they audibly expressed her to be.</p>

<p>The king was very much pleased with her
appearance, and received her very kindly,
telling her that if she desired to be his wife
she would have to gaze into the magic mirror,
and if she had done aught which was not consistent
with her maidenly character, the mirror
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>would show as many stains on its surface as
there might be blemishes on her heart.</p>

<p>“Sir,” replied the maiden, “we are all sinners
in the sight of God, they say; but I am a poor
shepherdess, and surrounded by my flock. I
have known what it is to be loved, for, when
the sheep have perceived danger, they have
come to me for protection. The wild flowers
have been my only ornament, the sky almost
my only roof, and God my truest and best
friend. Therefore, I fear not to look into that
magic mirror; for although I have no ambition
to become queen, yet am I not lacking in that
pride which is born of the desire to be good.”</p>

<p>Saying which, she walked up to the mirror
and gazed into it, blushing slightly, perhaps at
the sight of her own beauty, which before she
had only seen portrayed in the still brook.</p>

<p>The court ladies surrounded her; and when
they saw that the magic mirror showed no
stains on its surface, they snatched it from her,
and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is no magic in it&mdash;a cheat has been
put on us!”</p>

<p>But the king said&mdash;</p>

<p>“No, ladies; you have only yourselves to
thank. Had you been as innocent as this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>shepherdess, who is going to be my queen,
you would not have dreaded looking into the
mirror.”</p>

<p>After the marriage the barber was heard to
say, that as the magic mirror had now lost its
virtue, who could tell but what this charm
might be restored to Granada?</p>

<h2><a name="The_Black_Slave" id="The_Black_Slave"></a><i>THE BLACK SLAVE.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was once a princess who had a
black man slave.</p>

<p>“Princess,” said the black slave one day, “I
know that you love the good Count of Yanno
very much; but you cannot marry him, for he is
already married. Why not, then, marry me?”</p>

<p>“I love, as you say, the Count of Yanno,
and I know that he is married; but my father
is a very powerful king, and he can render his
marriage void. As for you,” continued the
princess, “I would rather marry the lowest
born man of my own race than a nigger!”</p>

<p>“Remember, princess, for how many years
I have been your true slave&mdash;how I used to
look after you when you were a child. Did I
not once save you from the fangs of a wolf?”</p>

<p>“You need not tell me,” answered the
princess, “that you love me as slaves love
their superiors; but should you ever speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>again about marrying me, I will tell my royal
father.”</p>

<p>“If you mention the love that slaves generally
have to their owners, I will not contradict you;
but I think that sometimes masters are more
unworthy the love of their slaves than the
slaves are entitled to the love of their masters,”
said the slave.</p>

<p>“You belong to us by purchase or by inheritance,”
continued the princess, “and we do
not belong to you. The white man gains the
love of the lady of his choice by deeds of arms;
he bears on his lance the banner embroidered
by his lady-love, and, as a true knight, he makes
verses in her honour.”</p>

<p>“Chivalry, as you understand it, is to me
a fable; for if one of your pale-faced knights
risk his life, it is on behalf of his family pride,
although he may mention his lady-love’s name
with his dying breath; but if a slave lay down
his life for his master or mistress, it is only
reckoned a part of his duty,” urged the slave.</p>

<p>“I command you not to speak to me again
like this,” said the princess, “or I will have you
severely punished.”</p>

<p>The poor slave was very sorrowful when he
heard the princess, whom he loved so dearly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>threaten to have him punished. “Death is the
leveller of all ranks and of all races,” said he;
“the dust of the dead white man and of the
nigger are alike; in death, the king is no more
than the beggar. I will run away from this
palace and seek refuge in the northern provinces,
where, if the climate be colder, they say the
hearts of the people are warmer.”</p>

<p>That very night did Mobarec&mdash;for that was
the name of the slave&mdash;leave the palace of his
lady-love, the beautiful banks of the Guadalquivir,
and his favourite orange-groves. During
the daytime he hid in the caves on the
mountain-sides, and as soon as night set in he
would continue his journey.</p>

<p>When he had been travelling like this for
some weeks, and as he was making his way
through a dark forest, he saw a brilliant light
in the distance; and as he was very hungry,
he hoped that it might be from some house
where he might get food and rest. As he
walked on he discovered that the light was
not from a house, but that it was caused by
a large bonfire, around which some men and
women were seated.</p>

<p>Fearing that he might be in the neighbourhood
of robbers, he took the precaution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>approaching by hiding behind the trees; and
when he got near enough to the group to see
them plainly, he observed that close to the fire
there was a very old woman standing with her
arms over the fire, and holding a child which
screamed as if it were being burned.</p>

<p>Mobarec thought that the child was going
to be roasted, and did not know that what he
saw was simply the act of disenchantment,
which was being carried out by the wise
woman of the village on a child born with the
evil eye.</p>

<p>Approaching still nearer, he heard the crone
mutter some words, which Mobarec imagined
to be used in order to stifle the piteous cries of
the child.</p>

<p>The crone suddenly commenced shrieking
and jumping over the fire, while the men and
women who surrounded her beat the air with
big sticks, which is done when the evil one
is supposed to be leaving the body of the
child.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Mobarec happened to
show himself from behind the tree, when he
was immediately observed by the wise woman,
who directed all eyes to him; and their horror
can be easily imagined when it is said that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Mobarec was the first nigger who had ever
visited the northern parts of Spain.</p>

<p>Mobarec, on perceiving that he was seen,
thought he would smile, in order to show them
that he was a friend; but this made him look
all the more terrible by the glare of the fire,
and, thinking that he was the evil one that had
just left the body of the child, they first of all
crossed themselves and then ran towards
Mobarec with their bludgeons, who, without
more ado, took to his feet and was soon lost
in the darkness of the forest.</p>

<p>Having baffled his pursuers, Mobarec sat down
to rest and to think over what he had seen.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said he to himself, “that these
people were trying to make a king by burning
a white child until he became black, for I could
see that they were not going to eat it. I have
been told that in some parts they will only
have black kings, and I am certainly in one of
these parts.”</p>

<p>Musing over this idea for a long time, he at
last fell asleep, and dreamt that he had arrived
at a large city, where the people had crowded
to meet him, and that he was placed on a
magnificent throne, crowned king, and had
married his dear princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>Then he thought he was in a magnificent
bed-chamber, and that the sheets of his bed
were fringed with fine lace; but purposing to
raise the richly embroidered clothes a little
higher, as he felt cold, he placed his hands on
some stinging nettles, which made him wake
and look around.</p>

<p>The day was already commencing; the timid
rabbit was lurking about the dew-spangled
leaves; the linnets were hopping about from
branch to branch, and the wheels of some
market carts were heard creaking in the distance.</p>

<p>Mobarec got up, and looking at himself in
the waters of a passing stream, he was surprised
to see that he had a golden crown on
his head. It was, however, but the morning
sun shining through the thick foliage above
him.</p>

<p>“I was a slave last night,” exclaimed Mobarec;
“this morning I am a king.”</p>

<p>He noticed the direction from which the
noise of the cart wheels proceeded, and
hurrying thither, he soon came within sight
of some people who were carrying their wares
to market.</p>

<p>Mobarec gradually approached them, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>seeing him advance, they dropped their baskets,
and would have run away if fear had not
deprived them of the power to do so.</p>

<p>“Be not afraid,” said the nigger, “for I am
your king. Hitherto you have had to work for
the rich, but now the rich shall work for you.
There shall be no poverty in my kingdom, no
hunger, and no sorrow. Bad husbands shall
take the place of the asses at the mills, and
quarrelsome wives shall have a borough to
themselves. Go,” continued he, addressing the
crowd, “and tell the inhabitants of the city
that I am approaching.”</p>

<p>“Long live the king!” shouted his hearers.
“Long live the good king who will free us
from our quarrelsome wives!” exclaimed the
men; “And who will send our cruel husbands
to replace the asses at the mills!” shrieked the
women. “Long live the king who will banish
poverty!” cried all together.</p>

<p>Having given vent to their enthusiasm, they
hurried off to the city, and the good news soon
spread that a new king was coming, and that
they would all be rich.</p>

<p>Then they prepared a richly caparisoned
white mule, with tinkling bells round its neck
and a cloth of gold on its back, for the black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>king’s use, and they went out in a body to meet
him.</p>

<p>Having approached Mobarec, they prostrated
themselves before him, and were at first very
much afraid; but hearing him address the mule
in a grand speech, they rose and listened.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Mobarec to the mule, “I feel
highly flattered by this ovation, and I confer
on you here the post of principal minister,
which you richly deserve for the sagacity you
have shown in preserving silence when all want
to make themselves heard. You will see that
the poor are provided for, and that they provide
for the wants of their king and his chosen
ministers, of which you are the chief. People,”
exclaimed Mobarec, “behold your king and
his minister! And from this day forward let
every man and woman in my kingdom strive
to be as sure-footed, patient, and silent as this
my minister.”</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the people were
somewhat surprised at the turn events had
taken; but as, recently, they had had a most
unjust chief minister, they contented themselves
with the knowledge that his successor
could not introduce any cruel measures.</p>

<p>With similar ideas occupying them, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>retraced their way to the city, preceded by
their black king and his chief minister.</p>

<p>Arrived at the palace, Mobarec entered and
took his seat on the throne, his chief minister
standing close to the lowest step. He then
addressed the audience as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>“I make it known that the rich persons of this
kingdom shall, if so required, give up their wealth
to the poor, who will then become rich; but, as
I would not that those who have hitherto been
poor should forget their duty to their more
unfortunate fellow-creatures, I declare that they
shall have to contribute not only to the maintenance
of the king, his ministers, and the
state, but also to the requirements of those at
whose expense they have themselves acquired
riches. I also command that all disputes shall
be submitted to the superior wisdom of my
chief minister, without whose verbal consent
it shall be treasonable to have recourse to
blows; and I further require of my liege subjects
that they engage in no war with neighbouring
states without taking their wives to
battle.”</p>

<p>This speech was very much applauded, and
the white mule, being unaccustomed to the
surroundings, commenced braying so loudly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>that Mobarec got up from his throne and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Listen to the voice of my minister; he bids
you all be silent while you pay him homage.”</p>

<p>Then one by one they passed before the
mule, bowing to him; and when this ceremony
was finished Mobarec informed them that all
real kings were of his colour, but that he had
resolved on marrying the daughter of Xisto,
false king of Andalusia; and, therefore, he commanded
twenty of his subjects to proceed to
that kingdom, and bring back with them the
fair Princess Zeyn, which was the name of the
princess he loved.</p>

<p>“If they ask you what I am like, say that
you have never seen one like me, and that my
wisdom is only approached by that of my chief
minister,” said Mobarec.</p>

<p>At the end of a month the twenty men
returned with the lovely princess, who, until
her marriage-day, was lodged in another
palace.</p>

<p>Great preparations were made for the occasion,
excepting in one borough of the city,
which was deserted, for it had been assigned to
all quarrelsome wives.</p>

<p>The princess was naturally very anxious to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>see her future husband, but etiquette forbade
her doing so. Often had she thought of her
runaway slave and lover. Absence had made
her fonder of him, and little by little he had
grown less black to her imagination.</p>

<p>At last the wedding-day arrived. Mobarec,
attended by all his court, proceeded to the
princess’s palace, dressed in magnificent apparel,
his strong black arms bare, but with
splendid gold bracelets round them, and a
belt of the same metal round his waist. His
coat of mail was interwoven with threads of
gold; but his heart required no gold to set it
off, it was purity itself.</p>

<p>As soon as the princess saw him she recognized
her former slave, and, hurrying to meet
him, threw her arms round his neck, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am not worthy to marry so good a man;
but if you will have me, I am yours.”</p>

<p>“Princess,” exclaimed Mobarec, “if I before
was thy slave, I am none the less so now; for
since the first man was created, beautiful
woman has made all men captives. If I have
aught to ask of thee now, ’tis that thy dominion
over thy new subjects shall be as pleasant to
them as it will be delightful to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>From so wise a king and good a queen the
people derived great benefit; disputes never
went beyond the ears of the chief minister,
and, in the words of the immortal barber and
poet of the city, “the kingdom flourished
under the guidance of a mule; which proves
that there are qualities in the irrational beings
which even wisest ministers would do well to
imitate.”</p>

<h2><a name="A_Legend_of_St_Bartholomew" id="A_Legend_of_St_Bartholomew"></a><i>A LEGEND OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> is a point of faith accepted by all devout
Portuguese that thirty-three baths in the
sea must be taken on or before the 24th of
August of every year. Although the motive
may not seem to be very reasonable, still the
result is of great advantage to those believers
who occupy thirty-three days in taking the
thirty-three baths, for otherwise the majority
of them would never undergo any form of
ablution.</p>

<p>That the demon is loose on the 24th of
August is an established fact among the credulous;
and were it not for the compact entered
into between St. Bartholomew and the said
demon, that all who have taken thirty-three
baths during the year should be free from his
talons, the list of the condemned would be
much increased.</p>

<p>Now, there was a very powerful baron, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>castle was erected on the eastern slope of the
Gaviarra, overlooking the neighbouring provinces
of Spain, and he had always refused to
take these thirty-three baths, for he maintained
that it was cowardly on the part of a man
to show any fear of the demon. His castle
was fully manned; the drawbridge was never
left lowered; the turrets were never left unguarded;
and a wide and deep ditch surrounded
the whole of his estates, which had been given
him by Affonso Henriques, after the complete
overthrow of the Saracens at Ourique, in
which famous and decisive battle the baron had
wrought wondrous deeds of bravery.</p>

<p>All round the castle were planted numerous
vines, which had been brought from Burgundy
by order of Count Henry, father of the first
Portuguese king; and in the month of August
the grapes are already well formed, but the
hand of Nature has not yet painted them.
Among the vines quantities of yellow melons
and green water-melons were strewn over the
ground, while the mottled pumpkins hung gracefully
from the branches of the orange-trees.</p>

<p>In front of the castle was an arbour, formed
of box-trees, under which a lovely fountain had
been constructed; and here, in the hot summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>months, would wander the baron’s only
daughter, Alina. She was possessed of all
the qualities, mental and physical, which went
towards making the daughter of a feudal lord
desired in marriage by all the gallants of the
day; and as she was heiress to large estates,
these would have been considered a sufficient
prize without the said qualities. But Alina, for
all this, was not happy, for she was enamoured of
a handsome chief, who, unfortunately, wore the
distinctive almexia, which proved him to be
a Moor, and, consequently, not a fit suitor for
the daughter of a Christian baron.</p>

<p>“My father,” she would often soliloquize, “is
kind to me, and professes to be a Christian.
My lover, as a follower of the Prophet, hates
my father, but, as a man, he loves me. For
me he says he will do anything; yet, when I
ask him to become a Christian, he answers me
that he will do so if I can prevail on my father
to so far conform with the Christian law as to
take the thirty-three baths; and this my father
will not do. What am I to do? He would
rather fight the demon than obey the saint.”</p>

<p>One day, however, she resolved on telling
her father about her courtship with the young
chief, Al-Muli, and of the only condition he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>made, on which depended his becoming a
convert to Christianity, which so infuriated the
baron that, in his anger, he declared himself
willing to meet the demon in mortal combat,
hoping thus to free the world of him and of
the necessity of taking the thirty-three baths.</p>

<p>This so much distressed Alina, that when,
during the afternoon of the same day, Al-Muli
met her in the arbour, she disclosed to him her
firm resolution of entering a convent, and
spending the rest of her days there.</p>

<p>“This shall not be!” cried Al-Muli; and,
seizing her round the waist, he lifted her on to
his shoulder, sped through the baronial grounds,
and, having waded through the ditch, placed
her on the albarda of his horse and galloped
away.</p>

<p>Alina was so frightened that she could not
scream, and she silently resigned herself to her
fate, trusting in the honour of her lover.</p>

<p>The alcazar, or palace, of Al-Muli was
situated on the Spanish side of the frontier;
and, as they approached the principal gate, the
almocadem, or captain of the guard, hurried to
receive his master, who instructed him to send
word to his mother that he desired of her to
receive and look after Alina. This done, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>assisted his bride elect to dismount, and, with
a veil hiding her lovely features, she was ushered
by Al-Muli’s mother into a magnificently
furnished room, and took a seat on a richly
embroidered cushion, called an almofada.</p>

<p>To her future mother-in-law she related all
that referred to her conversation with her
father, and how she had been brought away
from his castle; and she further said that she
very much feared the baron would summon all
his numerous followers to rescue her.</p>

<p>Al-Muli’s mother was a descendant of the
Moors who first landed at Algeziras, and from
them had descended to her that knowledge of
the black art which has been peculiar to that
race. She, therefore, replied that although she
could count on the resistance her almogavares,
or garrison soldiers, would offer to the forces
of the baron, still she would do her utmost
to avoid a conflict. She then proceeded to
another room, in which she kept her magic
mirror, and having closed the door, we must
leave her consulting the oracle.</p>

<p>The baron was not long in discovering the
absence of his daughter, and he so stormed
about the place that his servants were afraid to
come near him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>In a short time, however, his reason seemed
to return to him, and he sat down on his old
chair and gave way to grief when he saw that
his Alina’s cushion was vacant.</p>

<p>“My child&mdash;my only child and love,” sobbed
the old man, “thou hast left thy father’s
castle, and gone with the accursed Moor into
the hostile land of Spain. Oh, that I had
been a good Christian, and looked after my
daughter better! I have braved the orders of
good St. Bartholomew; I would not take the
thirty-three baths in the sea, and now I am
wretched!”</p>

<p>The baron suddenly became aware of the
presence of a distinguished and patriarchal
looking stranger, who addressed him thus&mdash;</p>

<p>“You mortals only think of St. Barbara
when it thunders. Now that the storm of
sorrow has burst on you, you reproach yourself
for not having thought of me and of my instructions.
But I see that you are penitent, and
if you will do as I tell you, you will regain
your daughter.”</p>

<p>It was St. Bartholomew himself who was
speaking, and the baron, for the first time in
his life, shook in his shoes with fear and shame.</p>

<p>“Reverend saint,” at last ejaculated the baron,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>“help me in this my hour of need, and I will
promise you anything&mdash;and, what is more, I
will keep my promises.”</p>

<p>“And you had better do so,” continued the
saint; “for not even Satan has dared to break
his compact with me. You don’t know how
terrible I can be!”&mdash;here the saint raised his
voice to such a pitch that the castle shook.
“Only let me catch you playing false with me,
and I’ll&mdash;I’ll&mdash;I don’t know what I’ll do!”</p>

<p>“Most reverend saint and father, you have
only to command me and I will obey,” murmured
the affrighted baron&mdash;“I will indeed.
Good venerable St. Bartholomew, only give me
back my daughter&mdash;that is all I ask.”</p>

<p>“Your daughter is now in the hands of
Al-Muli, her lover, who dwells in a stronger
castle than yours, and who, moreover, has a
mother versed in the black art. It is no good
your trying to regain her by the force at your
disposal; you must rely on me&mdash;only on me.
Do you understand?” asked the saint.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, good, noble, and venerable saint,
I do understand you; but what am I to do?”</p>

<p>“Simply follow me, and say not a word as
you go,” commanded the patriarch.</p>

<p>The baron did as he was told; and out from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>the castle the two went unseen by any one.
The baron soon perceived that he was hurrying
through the air, and he was so afraid of falling
that he closed his eyes. All at once he felt
that his feet were touching the ground; and,
looking around him, what was his delight
to find himself close to his dear daughter
Alina.</p>

<p>“Father&mdash;dear father!” exclaimed Alina;
“how did you come here so quickly, for I
have only just arrived? And how did you
pass by the guards?”</p>

<p>The baron was going to tell her, but the
saint, in a whisper, enjoined silence on this
point; and the baron now noticed that the
saint was invisible.</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear child, how I came here;
it is enough that I am here,” replied her father.
“And I intend taking you home with me, dear
Alina. The castle is so lonely without you;”
and the old man sobbed.</p>

<p>At this moment Al-muli entered the chamber,
and, seeing Alina’s father there, he thought
there had been treachery among his guards; so
striking a gong that was near him, a number of
armed men rushed in.</p>

<p>“How now, traitors!” said he. “How have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>you been careful of your duties when you have
allowed this stranger to enter unobserved?”</p>

<p>The soldiers protested their innocence, until
at last Al-muli commenced to think that there
must be some secret entrance into his castle.</p>

<p>“Search everywhere!” screamed the infuriated
Moor. “Have the guard doubled at all
the entrances, and send me up the captain!”</p>

<p>Al-muli’s instructions were carried out, and
the captain reported that all was safe.</p>

<p>“Old man,” said the Moor, addressing the
baron, “I have thee now in my power. Thou
wert the enemy of my noble race. To thy blind
rage my predecessors owed their downfall in
Portugal. Thy bitter hatred carried thee to
acts of vengeance. Thou art now in my power,
but I will not harm one of thy grey hairs.”</p>

<p>“Moor,” replied the baron, with a proud
look, “can the waters of the Manzanares and
of the Guadalquivir join? No! And so cannot
and may not thy accursed race join with
ours! Thy race conquered our people, and in
rising against thine we did but despoil the
despoiler.”</p>

<p>“Thy logic is as baseless as thy fury was
wont to be,” answered the Moor. “Though
hundreds of miles separate the Manzanares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>from the Guadalquivir, yet do they meet in the
mightier waters of the ocean. Hadst thou said
that ignorance cannot join hands with learning,
thou wouldst have been nearer the mark, or
that the Cross can never dim the light of the
Crescent.”</p>

<p>These words were spoken in a haughty
manner; and as Al-muli turned round and
looked upon his splendidly arrayed soldiers,
who surrounded the chamber, his pride seemed
justified.</p>

<p>“Thou canst not crush me more than thou
hast done, vile Moor,” said the baron. “Thou
hast robbed me of my daughter, not by force of
arms, but stealthily, as a thief at midnight. If
any spark of chivalry warmed thy infidel blood
thou wouldst blush for the act thou hast
wrought. But I fear thee not, proud Moor; thy
warriors are no braver than thy women. Dare
them to move, and I will lay thee at my feet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my father, and thou, dear Al-Muli,
abandon these threats, even if you cannot be
friends.”</p>

<p>“No, maiden,” exclaimed Al-Muli; “I will
not be bearded in my own den. Advance,
guards, and take this old man to a place of
safety below!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>But not a soldier moved; and when Al-Muli
was about to approach them to see what was
the matter with them, his scimitar dropped from
his hand, and he fell on the ground.</p>

<p>“What charm hast thou brought to bear on
me, bold baron,” screamed the Moor, “that I
am thus rendered powerless? Alina, if thou
lovest me, give me but that goblet full of water,
for I am faint.”</p>

<p>Alina would have done as her lover bade
her, but just then the figure of the venerable
St. Bartholomew was seen with the cross in his
right hand.</p>

<p>“Moor and infidel,” said the saint, “thou
hast mocked at this symbol of Christianity,
and thou hast done grievous injury to this
Christian baron; but thou hast been conscientious
in thy infidelity. Nor am I slow to
recognize in thy race a knowledge of the arts
and sciences not yet extended to the Christian.
Yet, for all this, thou art but an infidel. Let
me but baptize thee with the water thou
wouldst have drunk, and all will yet be
well.”</p>

<p>“No, sir saint,” answered the Moor. “When
in my castle strangers thus treat me rudely, I
can die, but not bend to their orders. If yonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>baron is a true Christian, why has he not taken
the thirty-three baths enjoined by thee?”</p>

<p>“And if my father do take them, wilt thou,
as thou didst promise me,” said Alina, “be
converted to the true faith?”</p>

<p>“The Moor breaks not his promise. As the
golondrina returns to its nest in due season, so
the man of honour returns to his promise.”
Then, turning to the baron, he demanded to
know if he would comply with the saint’s
instructions.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the baron; “I have promised
the good saint everything, and I will fulfil my
promises. Al-Muli, if you love my daughter,
love her faith also, and I will then have
regained not only a daughter, but a son in my
old age.”</p>

<p>“The promise of the Moor is sacred,” said
Al-Muli. “Baptize me and my household;
and do thou, good baron, intercede for me with
the venerable saint, for I like not this lowly
posture.”</p>

<p>“My dear Al-Muli,” sobbed Alina for joy,
“the Cross and the Crescent are thus united in
the mightier ocean of love and goodwill. May
the two races whom one God has made be
reconciled! And to-morrow’s sun must not set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>before we all comply with the condition imposed
by St. Bartholomew.”</p>

<p>The saint was rejoiced with the work he had
that day done, and declared that the churches
he liked men to construct are those built within
them, where the incense offered is prayer, and
the work done, love. “As for the baths, they
are but desirable auxiliaries,” said he.</p>

<h2><a name="The_White_Cat_of_Ecija" id="The_White_Cat_of_Ecija"></a><i>THE WHITE CAT OF ECIJA.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom</span> the gates of the palace, situated on
a gentle eminence in the vicinity of Ecija,
down to the banks of the Genil, the ground was
covered with olive-trees; and the wild aloes
formed a natural and strong fence around the
property of the White Cat of Ecija, whose
origin, dating back to the days of Saracenic
rule, was unknown to the liberated Spaniard.</p>

<p>There was a great mystery attaching to the
palace and its occupants; and although the
servants of the White Cat were to all appearances
human beings, still, as they were deaf
and dumb, and would not, or could not, understand
signs, the neighbours had not been able
to discover the secret or mystery.</p>

<p>The palace was a noble building, after the
style of the alcazar at Toledo, but not so large;
and the garden at the rear was laid out with
many small lakes, round which, at short distances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>stood beautifully sculptured statues of
young men and women, who seemed to be
looking sorrowfully into the water. Only the
brain and hand of an exceptionally gifted artist
could have so approached perfection as to
make the statues look as if alive. At night
strings of small lamps were hung round the
lakes, and from the interior of the palace proceeded
strains of sweet, but very sad music.</p>

<p>Curiosity had long ceased to trouble the
neighbours as to the mysterious White Cat
and her household, and, with the exception of
crossing themselves when they passed by the
grounds, they had given up the affair as incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Those, however, who had seen the White
Cat, said that she was a beautiful creature; her
coat was like velvet, and her eyes were like
pearls.</p>

<p>One day a knight in armour, and mounted
on a coal-black charger, arrived at the principal
hostelry in Ecija, and on his shield he bore
for his coat of arms a white cat rampant, and,
underneath, the device, “Invincible.”</p>

<p>Having partaken of some slight repast, he
put spurs to his horse and galloped in the
direction of the palace of the White Cat; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>as he was not seen to return through the town,
the people supposed that he had left by some
other road.</p>

<p>The White Cat was seen next day walking
about in the grounds, but she seemed more
sorrowful than usual.</p>

<p>In another month’s time there came another
knight fully equipped, and mounted on a grey
charger. On his shield he also displayed a
white cat, with the device, “I win or die.” He
also galloped off to the palace, or alcazar, and
was not seen to return; but next day the White
Cat was still more sorrowful.</p>

<p>In another month a fresh knight appeared.
He was a handsome youth, and his bearing
was so manly that a crowd collected. He was
fully equipped, but on his shield he displayed
a simple red cross. He partook of some food,
and then cantered out of the town with his
lance at rest. He was seen to approach the
palace, and as soon as he thrust open the gate
with his lance, a terrific roar was heard, and
then a sheet of fire flashed from the palace
door, and they saw a horrid dragon, whose
long tail, as it lashed the air, produced such a
wind that it seemed as if a gale had suddenly
sprung up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>But the gallant knight was not daunted, and
eagerly scanned the dragon as if to see where
he might strike him.</p>

<p>Suddenly it was seen that the dragon held
the White Cat under its talons, so that the
Knight of the Cross in charging the dragon had
to take care not to strike her. Spurring his
horse on, he never pulled up till he had transfixed
the dragon with his lance, and, jumping
off the saddle, he drew his sword and cut off
the monster’s head.</p>

<p>No sooner had he done this than he was
surrounded by ten enormous serpents, who
tried to coil round him; but as fast as they
attacked him, he strangled them.</p>

<p>Then the serpents turned into twenty black
vultures with fiery beaks, and they tried to
pick out his eyes; but with his trusty blade
he kept them off, and one by one he killed
them all, and then found himself surrounded
by forty dark-haired and dark-eyed lovely
maidens, who would have thrown their arms
around him, but that he, fearing their intentions
were evil, kept them off; when, looking on the
ground, he saw the White Cat panting, and
heard her bid him “strike.”</p>

<p>He waited no longer, but struck at them and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>cut off their heads, and then saw that the
ground was covered with burning coal, which
would have scorched the White Cat and killed
her, had not the gallant knight raised her in
his arms. He then placed her on his shield,
and as soon as she touched the cross she was
seen to change into a beautiful maiden, and all
the statues round the lakes left their positions
and approached her.</p>

<p>As soon as she could recover herself sufficiently
to speak, she addressed the knight as
follows&mdash;</p>

<p>“Gallant sir, I am Mizpah, only daughter
of Mudi Ben Raschid, who was governor
of this province for many years under the
Moorish king, Almandazar the Superb. My
mother was daughter of Alcharan, governor
of Mazagan, and she was a good wife and kind
mother. But my father discovering that she
had forsaken the faith of her fathers, and had
embraced the religion of the Cross, so worried
her to return to her childhood’s faith that she
died broken-hearted. Then he married again,
and his second wife, my stepmother, was a
very wicked woman. She knew that I was
a Christian at heart, and that my lover was
also a Christian; so one day, when my father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>was holding a banquet, she said to him, ‘Mudi
Ben Raschid, the crescent of the Holy Prophet
is waning in thy family&mdash;thy daughter is a
renegade!’</p>

<p>“Then he was very much annoyed, and exclaimed
that he would his palace and his riches
were made over to the enemy of mankind and
I turned into a cat, than that so great a stain
should fall on his family. No sooner had he
finished speaking than he fell dead and his
wicked wife also, and I was turned into a cat;
my lover, Haroun, and all my young friends
were turned into stone, and my servants were
stricken deaf and dumb. Many a brave knight
has been here to try and deliver me; but they
all failed, because they only trusted in themselves,
and were therefore defeated. But thou,
gallant knight, didst trust more on the Cross
than on thyself, and thou hast freed me. I
am, therefore, the prize of thy good sword;
deal with me as thou wilt.”</p>

<p>The Knight of the Cross assured her that
he came from Compostella, where it was considered
a duty to rescue maidens in distress,
and that the highest reward coveted was that
of doing their duty. He had in various parts
of the world been fortunate enough in freeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>others, and he had still more work before him.
He trusted that the lovely Mizpah might long
be spared to Haroun, and, saluting her, he
galloped off.</p>

<p>Then was the wedding held, at which all the
people from Ecija attended; and the bridegroom,
rising, wished prosperity to the good
knight, St. James of Compostella, who had been
the means of bringing about so much happiness.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Church_Auctioneer" id="The_Church_Auctioneer"></a><i>THE CHURCH AUCTIONEER AND
CLOWN OF VILLAR.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>own</span> the slopes of the neighbouring
mountains were heard the stirring sounds
of the bagpipes and drums, and at short intervals
a halfpenny rocket would explode in mid-air,
streaking the blue sky with a wreath of
smoke.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the sounds, and the
villagers stood at their cottage doors waiting
for the musicians to pass. Next to the firing
of rockets nothing can be more heart-stirring
than the martial sound of the pipes and drums.
The big drum was, on this occasion, played
most masterly by the auctioneer and clown
of the parish church, called José Carcunda, or
Joseph the Hunchback.</p>

<p>José Carcunda was dressed in his gala
uniform&mdash;cocked hat, scarlet coat with rich
gold lace embroidery, white trousers, and red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>morocco slippers. He was a clever man, and
could take many parts in the church plays acted
in public for the benefit of the faithful. Sometimes
he was Herod, at others, St. Joseph;
again he would appear as Judas, and then as
Solomon; but in this latter capacity he had
given some offence to the vicar by appearing
on the stage under the influence of drink.</p>

<p>Of all the weaknesses to which human flesh
is heir, none is more despised in Portugal than
drunkenness. Wine is emblematical of that
stream which flowed from the Crucified on
Calvary, and the abuse of such a precious gift
is not easily overlooked.</p>

<p>Within the narrow bounds of their primitive
way of thinking are cast some of the finest
traits in the character of the Portuguese
peasantry, although, in many instances, to this
very same source must be attributed some of
their peculiar ideas as to fate. They are
fatalists to a very great extent.</p>

<p>In Roman Catholic countries, the Sabbath
is remembered by attending mass in the
morning, and by amusements in the afternoon.
No public-house, with its glittering lights within,
with its bright and cosy fire, and with its
grand display of mirrors and pictures, invites
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>the peasant to step inside and gossip about his
neighbours, while sipping the genial juice of
the grape, or the <i>fire-water</i> that gives to the
eye a supernatural brightness, and to the
tongue a rush of foolish language. There is
no law against such houses, but there is a
popular prejudice.</p>

<p>José Carcunda was heard to say, after he
had been guilty of drinking to excess when
attired as Solomon, that his faithful dog Ponto
refused to accompany him home on that
occasion; “And as the creature stared at me,”
said he, “I could see shame and sorrow
mingling in his eyes.”</p>

<p>“There comes the Carcunda!” exclaimed the
village belle, Belmira. “He is half hidden by
the drum; but to-morrow we shall see him at
early mass, when the good St. Anthony is to
be raised to the rank of major.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her lover, Manoel; “and it will
be a grand sight, for the priest showed me the
<i>Gazette</i> in which is the king’s warrant. St.
Anthony’s regiment is to arrive to-morrow, and
after the image has donned the uniform the
soldiers will present arms, the bombs will
explode, rockets will be fired, and the band
will play.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>As the musicians entered the village,
heralding the grand entertainment to be held
next day, the people cheered them heartily,
and followed them to the church, situated on
the top of a small hill, around which bonfires
were in course of preparation for the night.</p>

<p>A cart laden with water-melons, another with
a pipe of green wine, and a few stalls where
sweetstuff was exposed for sale, formed the
principal feature of the fair.</p>

<p>The door of the church was thrown open,
and the main altar was lit up with many lights.
The chapels on each side were festooned with
garlands of flowers; but that dedicated to the
miraculous St. Anthony, junior major in the
10th regiment of infantry, was the grandest of
all, with its magnificent silk draperies, and the
altar decorated with flowers.</p>

<p>José Carcunda was a proud man that day.
He had presided over all the arrangements,
and they had given great satisfaction. Belmira
had set the other girls the example of showing
him their gratitude by kissing him. He was
so overwhelmed by their caresses that he tried
to get clear of them, lest his wife might be
jealous; but it was of no use trying to free
himself, for they made him sit on a stone bench,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>and, handing him a guitar, requested him to
extemporize some verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Fair ladies mine, I love the wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But music I love better;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still stronger far than song divine,<br /></span>

<p>“No, I cannot sing just now; I am too
happy,” exclaimed the hunchback. “I feel like
the rich miser of Santillana, when he recollected
that he would be buried at the expense of the
parish. So as my helpmate Joanna come not
here, I care not how long the troops delay in
arriving. Ah, Joanna is too good for me, as
the runaway criminal said of the gallows; and
the older she gets the more I recognize it!
Yes, Joanna is too good for me and for this
world; but we don’t make ourselves&mdash;no, we
don’t do that.”</p>

<p>Here José Carcunda shook his head very
wisely, and looked at his slippered feet with
some pardonable pride.</p>

<p>“Look you here,” said one of his fair companions,
“you are very stupid to-day; you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>not sing, nor will you dance. Will you, then,
tell us the tale about the sorrowful mule, and
what befell her, or about the merry friar who
turned highwayman to enrich the Church, or
about the palaces of the enchanted Moors?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you something that happened to
me when I was a young man,” answered the
hunchback.</p>

<p>“Know, then,” continued José Carcunda,
“that in my younger days I was an almocreve
(muleteer), and owned six of the finest mules
in the province of the Beira. I used to attend
the weekly fair held at the university city,
Coimbra, where I found a good market for my
earthenware with which I loaded the mules.</p>

<p>“Fortune had favoured me, and I had saved
some gold crowns; and on Sundays, when I
had shaved and put on clean linen, I was the
pride of the village.</p>

<p>“One summer’s day, as I was leading my
six mules, fully laden with pots and pans, to
Coimbra, a student, who was on the roadside,
saluted me and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Good José, I have a great favour to ask
of you, and one that I know you will not deny
me.’</p>

<p>“‘Your excellency,’ said I, ‘has but to order,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>and I will obey, so long as you place not my
eternal happiness in jeopardy.’</p>

<p>“‘The saints forbid,’ answered the student,
‘that I should ask you to do anything but what
a Christian man should do! No, friend José,
my errand is indeed a strange and sad one;
but I feel that I must be as true to (with your
leave) a mule as my profession requires me to
be to a human being.’</p>

<p>“‘What!’ exclaimed I, ‘are you under some
spell, some wicked enchantment, that you make
promises to (with your excellency’s leave) a
mule, which is the accursed animal since the
days of Bethlehem?’</p>

<p>“‘No, good friend,’ continued the sorrowful
student; ‘I am under no spell, but under a vow;
for I have promised to convey some sad news
to (with your leave) that mouse-coloured mule
of yours, and I feel that I must break it gently
to her.’</p>

<p>“‘Sir,’ said I, ‘you see before you a man
who knows not the difference between the
<i>Credo</i> and the <i>Paternoster</i> when they are
written; and though I have heard say that if
you want to see thieves you must get inside
a prison and look at the passers-by, still am I
not inclined to think that if you desire to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>knaves you must look in at the windows of the
university. My mule (with your excellency’s
permission) is but a mule, and has no knowledge
of sorrow or of language; therefore, of
what avail to speak to her?’</p>

<p>“‘You are much mistaken,’ answered the
student, who now had tears in his eyes, ‘for it
is well known that even the irrational animals
have feelings, and they have been heard to
speak. Good friend, grant me my request, for,
as I said before, I am under a vow.’</p>

<p>“‘Have your way, dear sir,’ said I; ‘but if
the animal bites you, blame not me. She is
but a stubborn thing at the best of times.’</p>

<p>“The six mules were tied one to the other,
and each had a big load of pots and pans.
They were standing in the middle of the road
with their gay trappings and bells about them;
and as I looked at the mouse-coloured one, I
wondered what the student could have to say
to her and how he would say it; but, as you
know, these men who frequent the university
are so learned that they can repeat the <i>Credo</i>
backwards way, which is the great secret in the
black art.</p>

<p>“The student, having obtained my permission
to speak to the mouse-coloured mule,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>approached her gradually, exclaiming at intervals,
‘Poor creature, how she will take it to
heart! But I am under a vow. I must tell
her&mdash;I must; but it is so painful!’</p>

<p>“‘Senhor,’ I exclaimed, ‘you remind me of
the Alcaide of Montijo, who hesitated to
approach his mother-in-law until she was
gloved. What you have to say, that say, and
let me go my way.’</p>

<p>“‘Unthoughtful man!’ cried the student;
‘little you wot of the sad news I have to break
to that poor creature! To you a mule is but
a four-legged creature, the cathedral bell but
a thing of brass, and the university but the
abode of the black art. You are absolutely
ignorant, sir,’ continued the student, ‘for which
you have much to be thankful; for if you were
a student you would not sell earthenware pans,
and would therefore lose the profit which you
now make; and were you a student, you would
at this moment be all of a tremble, for you
would then know that we are at this present
moment standing over a frightful abyss that
will soon yawn to receive its prey.’</p>

<p>“I was now terribly frightened lest the
student, in his calculations, should have made
the mistake of a minute, so I rushed to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>foremost mule so as to get her to lead the way
out of the danger; but the student prevented
me, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Not that way, for you will fall into the pit.
Let me first of all whisper my news into the
mouse-coloured mule’s ear, and all may yet be
well.’</p>

<p>“‘Hurry, then,’ said I, ‘or else we shall all
be lost.’</p>

<p>“‘It is a very good thing to be in a hurry
when you know what to do,’ answered the
student; ‘but we must be cautious. Therefore,
step lightly that way until you reach yonder
lofty tree and get up it; but, before doing so,
fill your pockets with stones.’</p>

<p>“I can assure you that I was not long in
carrying out the student’s instructions, and
never have I trod so lightly on the ground as
I did that day. The student, as soon as he
saw me half-way up the tree, shouted out,
‘Here it comes! Oh, this is awful&mdash;just as I
told her all about it! Oh dear, oh dear!’</p>

<p>“I now noticed that the student was taking
long jumps in the direction of the tree up
which I had climbed, and at every jump he
would call out, ‘Shut your eyes, or you will
become blind!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>“Then I heard a most dreadful noise, as if
the end of the world had come; but I could
still hear the student crying out, ‘Shut your
eyes, good friend, or you will be blinded!’</p>

<p>“I have never been so terrified either before
or since that day, and I was also in considerable
pain, as the stones which I had placed in
the pockets of my pants had, with climbing,
almost sunk into me.</p>

<p>“After having kept my eyes closed for some
time, I ventured on opening them, and then I
saw a sight which told me I was a ruined man.
My mules were rolling about in the dust, and
all my pots and pans were wrecked. The
mouse-coloured mule, moreover, seemed to be
demented; she rolled and writhed so that it
seemed as if she were in awful distress, and
there was no doubt but that she had dragged
the others down with her.</p>

<p>“Suddenly I heard the voice of the student,
and, looking down, I saw that he was seated on
a branch just below me. ‘Ah, poor creature,’
said he, ‘how terribly she feels the bereavement!
Let us descend,’ continued he, ‘for the
danger is now over, and we must, as Christian
men, render aid to the poor dumb animals.’
Saying which he slid down the tree, and I after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>him as well as I could; and as soon as we again
got on the road, he bid me try to pacify the
mouse-coloured mule, while he would do his
utmost to get the leader to get up.</p>

<p>“I saw that all my earthenware was broken,
and I gave myself up to grief. ‘Unlucky man
that I am!’ I exclaimed. ‘What harm can I
have done to have deserved so great a punishment,
and what, sir student, did you say to yon
mule to make her act so?’</p>

<p>“‘Alas, friend José,’ said he, ‘we of the
educated class understand resignation, but to
such as you, as well as to the irrational creation,
is this virtue denied. You bemoan the loss of
your earthenware; and yonder dumb creature,
with perhaps a glimmering of humanity about
her, but certainly with more reason than you,
deplores the loss of a good and beloved parent,
who, on his death-bed, implored me to inform
his daughter when I should next see her that
he had died thinking of her, and that he
bequeathed to her all he had to give, namely,
the right of pasturage over all the lands in Spain
and Portugal, and as much more as she could
snatch from her neighbour when in the stable.
Good-bye, friend José; my vow is accomplished,
and I leave you in peace with your mules.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>“‘And with the broken earthenware,’ said I,
‘and with my fortunes blasted, and with my
legs bleeding; and all because I met you!’</p>

<p>“‘Say not so, friend José, for had it not
been for me you would most assuredly have
been swallowed up by the underground abyss.
No, say not so, nor yet complain of your mouse-coloured
mule, for to lament the death of a
father is but natural.’</p>

<p>“The student walked quietly away, and I
then set to making the mules get up, which,
after much trouble, I succeeded in doing; but
noticing that the mouse-coloured mule kept
her head on one side as if in pain, I examined
her, and on looking into her ear I discovered
the end of a cigarette which that vile student
had purposely dropped into it. I now knew
that I had been deceived; but the cheat had
already disappeared, so, like a wise man, I
trudged home, sold my animals to pay my
debts, and, having nothing better to do, I
married Joanna and became, as you know, the
church clown and auctioneer.”</p>

<h2><a name="The_Wise_King_of_Leon" id="The_Wise_King_of_Leon"></a><i>THE WISE KING OF LEON.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was a rich nobleman who had
three sons; and the king, being very fond
of him, appointed the eldest son his page, the
second his butler, and the youngest his barber.</p>

<p>The barber fell in love with the king’s only
daughter, who was equally fond of him; and
when this came to the ears of the king, he
decided on putting a stop to it; so he called for
the princess, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I know that you are in love with my barber,
and if you insist on marrying him I will have
you killed.”</p>

<p>The princess, on hearing her father say this,
became very sorrowful, and asked him to allow
her one day for consideration, to which the
king acceded.</p>

<p>She then went to her room, and getting
together some of her finest dresses, she made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>them up into a bundle, and left the palace by
a secret door.</p>

<p>For seven days and nights did the princess
walk through the forest, subsisting on wild
fruit and the water from the rivulets. For
seven days and nights did her father seek for
her, and, not finding her, he sent for the barber,
and told him that he must immediately go in
search of the princess, and if he did not bring
her back within a year he should die.</p>

<p>At the end of the seventh day the princess
was so tired that she could not continue her
journey; and being afraid of the wolves, she
managed to climb on to the first branch of a
large oak-tree; and when there, discovering that
the trunk was hollow, she let herself slip down
into the hollow, and there rested.</p>

<p>She had not been long in her hiding-place
when her lover, the barber, approached, sighing,
and saying to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>“Woe is me, for I shall never find the princess!
There are so many lovely damsels in
Castille, and yet I must fall in love with the
king’s only daughter.”</p>

<p>The princess, hearing him speak, said in a
disguised voice&mdash;</p>

<p>“Woe is the king’s daughter! There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>so many gallants in Spain, and yet she must
fall in love with her father’s barber!”</p>

<p>The barber was much surprised to hear this
apt rejoinder; but he could not find out from
whence the voice came. He looked about
everywhere, and at last, feeling sleepy, he lay
down under the oak-tree where the princess
was hidden.</p>

<p>In a very short time the barber was fast
asleep; and the princess, hearing him breathe
heavily, got out of her hiding-place, mounted
the barber’s horse, which the king had given
him, and rode away with the barber’s bundle of
clothes, leaving her own in its place.</p>

<p>When she had ridden at full speed for some
hours she dismounted, and opening the barber’s
bundle, she then disrobed herself and put on
male attire.</p>

<p>Next day she had arrived in the kingdom of
Leon, and she rode up to the king’s palace and
offered her services to the king as barber.</p>

<p>The king, being much struck by the stately
bearing of the stranger, willingly accepted the
proffered services.</p>

<p>When the real barber awoke and found his
horse and clothes gone he was much alarmed;
but seeing a bundle close to him he opened it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>and was delighted to find his lover’s dresses
in it.</p>

<p>Being a beardless youth, and very handsome,
he bethought him of putting on the princess’s
finest dress; and as his hair was very long and
curly, according to the fashion of the day, he
made a very pretty woman.</p>

<p>Foot-sore and weary, he at last arrived at the
palace of the King of Leon, and was admitted
to the king’s presence as the daughter of the
neighbouring King of Castille.</p>

<p>The King of Leon was so charmed with the
beauty of the new arrival that he could not
sleep, and so he sent for the barber, to whom
he confided his love.</p>

<p>The real princess was much astonished to
hear that her lover was in the palace, for she
guessed it was he in female attire; but she
kept quiet until her lover was asleep in bed,
and then she stole into his room, put back his
clothes, and took her own away.</p>

<p>Next morning when the real barber awoke
and found his magnificent dresses gone and his
male attire restored to him he was indeed surprised;
but there was no help for it&mdash;he must
again become a man and a barber.</p>

<p>The princess put on her own clothes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>hid in a cupboard of the room. When she saw
her lover leave the room, and heard him go
down the staircase, she closed the door behind
him and finished her toilet.</p>

<p>The king got up earlier than usual, for he was
so anxious to see the new arrival; but before
doing so he sent for the barber to shave him.</p>

<p>They looked everywhere for him, but without
success; and at last, in despair, they went to
the bedroom of the new arrival, and, knocking
at the door, intimated the king’s command that
she should present herself.</p>

<p>The princess was ready; and, slipping past
the courtiers, presented herself before the king.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” inquired the king.</p>

<p>“I am the daughter of the King of Castille,
as I informed your mercy yesterday,” answered
the princess.</p>

<p>“But where, then, is my barber?” rejoined
the king.</p>

<p>“What does one king’s daughter know
about another king’s barber?” said the princess.</p>

<p>At this moment the real barber presented
himself, and humbly begged the king’s pardon
for having deceived him.</p>

<p>“But who are you?” roared the king. “Are
you a barber or a thief?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>“I am the youngest son of a marquess,”
answered the youth, “a barber by trade, and
affianced to the daughter of the King of
Castille.”</p>

<p>Then the princess stepped forward and
explained everything to the king, who was so
interested with what he heard, that the princess
and the barber had to tell the tale over and
over again to him. Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have been shaved by the King of Castille’s
daughter, and I have courted his barber.
I will not be again deceived. They shall now
be man and wife for ever.”</p>

<p>This was the wise King of Leon.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Cobbler_of_Burgos" id="The_Cobbler_of_Burgos"></a><i>THE COBBLER OF BURGOS.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ot</span> far from the Garden of the Widows,
in Burgos, lived a cobbler who was so
poor that he had not even smiled for many
years. Every day he saw the widow ladies
pass his small shop on the way to and from the
garden; but in their bereavement it would not
have been considered correct for them to have
bestowed a glance on him, and they required
all the money they could scrape together, after
making ample provision for their comfort&mdash;which,
as ladies, they did not neglect&mdash;to pay
for Masses for the repose of the souls of their
husbands, according to the doctrines of the
faith which was pinned on to them in childhood.</p>

<p>The priests, however, would sometimes bestow
their blessing on Sancho the cobbler; but
beyond words he got nothing from the comforters
of the widows and of the orphans.</p>

<p>Some of the great families would have their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>boots soled by him; but being very great and
rich people, they demanded long credit, so that
he was heard to say that a rich man’s money
was almost as scarce as virtue.</p>

<p>Now, one night, when he was about to close
his shop, a lovely young widow lady pushed
her way by him into the shop, and sitting on
the only chair in the room, she bid him close
the door immediately, as she had something to
say to him in confidence.</p>

<p>Being a true Spaniard, he showed no surprise,
but obeyed orders, and stood before the young
widow lady, who, after looking at him carefully
for a minute, implored him to go upstairs and
see that the windows were secure and the
shutters barred and bolted.</p>

<p>This done, he again stood before her, when
she showed signs of fear, and requested him to
ensure against the doors being burst open by
piling what furniture he had against them and
against the shutters; and then, assuring herself
that she was safe, she exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ah, friend Sancho, it is good to beware of
evil tongues. I come to you because I know
you to be honest and silent. To-night you
must sleep on the roof; get out through the
skylight, and I will rest here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>To refuse a lady’s commands, however
singular they may be, is not in the nature of a
Spaniard, so Sancho got out through the skylight,
when the young widow began screaming,
“Let me out, kind people&mdash;let me out!”</p>

<p>The cobbler was now very much afraid of
the consequences, especially as the night watchmen
were banging against the street door,
which they soon forced, knocking all the
furniture which had been placed against it
into the middle of the room.</p>

<p>When inside, they discovered the lovely
young widow, who exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good men, I am Guiomar, of Torrezon,
widow of the noble Pedro de Torrezon, and
because my late husband was owing Sancho for
soling a pair of boots, I came here to pay the
debt; but Sancho would have detained me
against my will. He is concealed on the roof
of the house, and if you leave me here he will
murder me.”</p>

<p>Then she naturally fainted and screamed for
so long a time that the street was soon full of
people who, hearing what had happened, cried
out against Sancho.</p>

<p>The watchmen having secured him, he was
led before the alcaide, and, being a poor man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>he was sent to prison until such time as Donna
Guiomar should feel disposed to pardon him.</p>

<p>At the end of a year Donna Guiomar
obtained his liberty, but on the condition that
he should forthwith proceed to Rome and do
penance, which was to count for the benefit of
her deceased husband.</p>

<p>This act of piety on her part was very much
approved of by the priests, who required of
Sancho that during the whole of his pilgrimage
there he should not shave, nor have his hair
nor his nails cut. He was, furthermore, to
wear a suit of horse-hair cloth next to his skin,
and was to subsist solely on onions, garlic, maize
bread, and pure water.</p>

<p>But liberty is so sweet that Sancho did not
mind his hard fare, and he went on his way to
Rome repeating penitential prayers, while his
hair and beard grew until his head and face
were nearly hidden.</p>

<p>Arrived at Rome, the people wondered much
to see such a strange-looking being; but when
he opened his mouth to inquire his way to
St. Peter’s, so strong was the smell of onions
and garlic that the people, accustomed as they
were to these vegetables, could not stand against
it, and as Sancho spoke in a foreign tongue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>they could not have understood him very
easily.</p>

<p>At last he met a priest who was kind enough
to listen to him, and he said he would be
allowed audience of the Pope next morning
with other pilgrims, but that meantime he had
better confess what his fault had been.</p>

<p>Sancho recounted all about the lovely young
widow, and the priest very properly admonished
him for having dared to frighten a lady whose
anxiety respecting her deceased husband was
quite enough of sorrow without having it added
to by being forcibly detained by a cobbler.</p>

<p>“It is a pity,” said the worthy priest, “that
you were not handed over to the inquisitorial
brothers, for they would have burned you
before you were allowed to import the odour
of all the fields of Spanish onions and garlic
into the Eternal City. It is a sign of the bad
times that are approaching when errant cobblers
are allowed to vitiate the precincts of St. Peter’s
with their pestilential breath. To-morrow you
will be regaled with a view&mdash;mind, only a view&mdash;of
his holiness’s toe, and then you must
depart this city.”</p>

<p>Sancho recognized the truth of what the
good priest said, and, having refreshed himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>with some more onions and a glass of water,
he lay down to sleep behind one of the large
stone pillars and slept until next morning, when
the large bell of the cathedral awoke him. He
then hurried in to the presence of the Pope,
nor had he much difficulty in so doing, for the
other pilgrims were glad to get out of his way.
Bowing low before the golden chair, he
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2><a name="Barbara_the_Graziers_Wife" id="Barbara_the_Graziers_Wife"></a><i>BARBARA, THE GRAZIER’S WIFE.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> Spain was fortunately in possession
of the enlightened Moors a spirit
of chivalry pervaded all classes, which degenerated
after the departure of Boabdil from
Granada.</p>

<p>The Moorish blood permeated the veins of
the majority of the Spaniards; but a religious
despotism completely subdued the minds of
all, and Spain, under the yoke of the Jesuits,
became a land more famed for its <i>autos da fé</i>
than for its progress in the fine arts and
sciences, which, to a very great extent, were
ignored.</p>

<p>Some there were, however, in whom the
blood of the Moors was stronger than the faith
in their new religion, which, however good in
the abstract, was most pernicious in its consequences.</p>

<p>It has been the abuse, not the use, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>Christian religion which has made of the
Spaniard what his conqueror, the Moor, would
have most loathed.</p>

<p>In the province of Galliza is situated the
village of Porrinho, lying in a beautiful valley,
and surrounded by meadow-land and fields of
maize.</p>

<p>Here lived the merry grazier, Sebastian de
las Cabras, famous for his encounters with
wolves, but looked down upon by his neighbours
because it was known that he was
descended from the Moors.</p>

<p>In all the village there was not a man could
handle the quarter-staff like Sebastian, and so
correct was his aim that, with a sling, he would
at a hundred yards hurl a stone and hit a bull
between the eyes, and so kill it.</p>

<p>With his knife he was equally skilful, for he
could use the blade to pick up the oil from his
plate instead of licking it up with a spoon, or,
in a quarrel, make it find a sheath in the leg or
arm of a rival.</p>

<p>Now, this Sebastian, with all his ingenuity
and merriment, had, like most men, a grievance;
but, unlike most men’s grievances, his was
against the good St. Vincent, whose patched-up
body (some of it, having decayed, being filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>up with wax) is entombed in different cathedrals
throughout Spain and Portugal, each
cathedral professing to possess the veritable
body of the veritable saint.</p>

<p>But in this plurality of St. Vincent there is
nothing singular; for did they not fill three
large ships with the eye-teeth of good St.
James of Compostella when they were written
for from Rome, and did not the Pope declare
them all genuine teeth?</p>

<p>Spain, in her religious fanaticism, is no more
like other countries than Sebastian de las
Cabras was like other men.</p>

<p>St. Vincent, be it known, is worshipped in
the Peninsula as the guardian saint against that
horrible scourge, small-pox.</p>

<p>In Galliza it is declared all diseases and
misfortunes in life were produced in order that
there should be patron saints; and this is just
as true as the saying in Leon, that wheat was
produced so that there might be stomachs.</p>

<p>Sebastian de las Cabras cared neither for the
saints nor for the sayings; he feared neither
the law nor the evil one; but he quailed before
his wife, D. Barbara, whose beauty, like that of
the demolished alcazar at Ecija, was a thing of
the past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>D. Barbara was, however, a woman who
made herself respected; and of all the saints
in the calendar there was none for whom she
had so great a veneration as St. Vincent, who
had saved her when suffering from small-pox.</p>

<p>Not the three wives who got up from
their graves in Merida and appeared to the
husband to whom they had all been married,
produced a more startling effect on that
widower than D. Barbara on her husband
Sebastian, when she would visit him as he
was tending his herds on the mountain sides,
for no woman ever had such a tongue. Even
the Archbishop of Compostella, in pity to the
clergy of his diocese, had ordained that D. Barbara
needed no confession. He absolved her
from all sin for the love and veneration she had
for St. Vincent, but blamed the good saint for
the mercy he had shown D. Barbara.</p>

<p>Sebastian de las Cabras had been to the
tombs of St. Vincent in Compostella, in Salamanca,
Cadiz, Malaga, and Seville, to induce
the good saint to undo his good work; but the
bodies were inexorable, and Barbara continued
to plague him with her tongue, and to mark
him with her nails.</p>

<p>Seeing that he could get no relief for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>home troubles from St. Vincent, Sebastian
recollected the faith of his fathers, and bethought
of applying for advice to an old Moor
who lived in the neighbouring village.</p>

<p>To this wise man he therefore went; and,
after explaining matters, he declared that he
bore no ill-will to his wife, but rather to the
saint, for that it was owing to him that D. Barbara
was spared.</p>

<p>“It is a difficult matter,” said the Moor,
“and one that will require great consideration
and prudence before attempting to master it.
You Christians make saints to serve you, and
because your interests are not all alike you
blame the saints for not doing what is obviously
impossible. Now, I know that he whom you
call St. Vincent loved the tongue of a woman
no better than the scimitar of the Saracen, and
for this reason did he probably prefer to spare
the life of D. Barbara than be importuned by
her in his place of rest.”</p>

<p>“What, then, would you advise me to do, for
with D. Barbara I can no longer live?”</p>

<p>“There are St. Nicholas, St. Tiburtius,
St. Bartholomew, and others who equally fear
the noise of a woman’s tongue; but little St.
Francis died stone-deaf, and being naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>of an envious disposition, nothing would please
him better than to revenge himself on his
colleagues by foisting D. Barbara on to them.”</p>

<p>“But if little St. Francis be deaf, how shall
I make him hear my complaint?” demanded
Sebastian.</p>

<p>“Thou art no true Catholic if thou knowest
not the weakness of the saints in general, but
of their keepers here on earth in particular.
Thou mayest shout thyself deaf, dance, and
jump, but they may not hear thee; but if thou
showest them the bright yellow gold thou wilt
be heard and understood, even if thou hadst
not a voice, and wert as dumb as thou wouldst
wish D. Barbara to be,” answered the Moor.</p>

<p>“I will away, then, to the market and sell
some of my finest beasts, and the money which
I receive for them will I gladly bestow on little
St. Francis,” said Sebastian.</p>

<p>The oxen were sold, and Sebastian hurried
away with the money to the shrine of little
St. Francis; and after devoutly praying, he
proceeded to count out the gold pieces one by
one; and great was his joy when he noticed
the saint commence to move, open his eyes,
stretch out his hands, and declare that Sebastian’s
petition should be granted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>That very night when Sebastian and his
wife were in bed, and the latter was delivering
a lengthy lecture on the coarseness and want of
breeding in snoring when a lady was speaking,
little St. Francis appeared at the bedside with
a mirror in his hand.</p>

<p>“Barbara,” said the saint, “thy virtues are
known to us, and as a reward we have decreed
that thou shalt be restored to youth and beauty,
which thou shalt thyself behold when looking
into this mirror; but beware no angry or vain
words pass thy lips, for then will thy lack of
modesty be punished by hideous old age and
infirmity, therefore, beware!” And saying this,
he left the now happy pair&mdash;Barbara admiring
herself in the mirror by the light of a cruse,
and Sebastian enjoying that unbroken sleep
which he had not known for years.</p>

<p>The mirror never passed out of D. Barbara’s
possession, and was never known to leave her
hand until her frame, gradually tired out by
want of rest, succumbed to the fascination of
little St. Francis’s gift and the wisdom of the
friendly Moor.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Watchful_Servant" id="The_Watchful_Servant"></a><i>THE WATCHFUL SERVANT.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was once a prince who was going
to visit his lady-love, the only daughter
of a neighbouring king; and as he required
the services of an attendant, he sent for his
barber, who was known in the town for his very
good behaviour, as well as for his eccentric
ways.</p>

<p>“Pablo,” said the prince, “I want you to go
with me to Granada to assist me on my journey.
I will reward you handsomely, and you shall
lack for nothing in the way of food. But you
must don my livery, salute me in the fashion
of Spain, hold my stirrup when I mount, and
do everything that is required of a servant.
Above all, you must not let me oversleep myself,
for otherwise I shall be late in arriving at
Granada.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” answered the barber, “I will be as
true to you as the dog was to St. Dominic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>When you are sleeping I will be on guard, and
when you are awake I will see that no harm
approaches you; but I beg you not to be
annoyed with me if, in trying to be of service
to you, I do unwillingly cause you any annoyance.”</p>

<p>“Good Pablo,” continued the prince, “say
no more, but return to your shop, pack up your
linen, and come here as soon as you can this
evening. If I am in bed when you arrive, you
will know that it is because I must get up to-morrow
morning by five o’clock, and see to it
that you let me not sleep beyond that time.”</p>

<p>Pablo hurried home, packed up his few
articles of underclothing, and then proceeded
to the principal wine tavern to tell his friends
of his good fortune. They were all so pleased
to hear of Pablo’s good luck that they drank to
his health, and he returned the compliment so
often that at last the wine was beginning to tell
on him, so he bid his friends good-bye and left,
saying to himself, “I must wake his highness
at five o’clock.” This he kept repeating so
often that he had arrived at the large courtyard
of the palace before he was aware of it.</p>

<p>The prince’s bedroom looked into the courtyard,
and Pablo saw by the dim light that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>burning in the room that the prince had retired
to rest.</p>

<p>Afraid lest the prince should think he had
forgotten all about awaking him, and that he
might therefore be keeping awake, Pablo seized
a long cane, with which he tapped at the window
of the prince, and kept on tapping until the
prince appeared, and opened the window, shouting
out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Who is there? Who wants me?”</p>

<p>“It is I,” said Pablo. “I have not forgotten
your orders; to-morrow morning I will wake
your highness at five.”</p>

<p>“Very good, Pablo; but let me sleep awhile,
or else I shall be tired to-morrow.”</p>

<p>As soon as the prince had disappeared Pablo
commenced thinking over all the princes of
whom he had heard, and he had become so
interested in the subject that when he heard
the cock crow, imagining it was daybreak, he
again seized the cane and tapped loudly at the
window.</p>

<p>The prince again lifted up the sash, and cried
out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Who is it? What do you want? Let me
sleep, or else I shall be tired to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” exclaimed the barber, “the cock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>has already crowed, and it must be time to
rise.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” replied the prince, “for
it is only half an hour ago since you woke me;
but I am not annoyed with you.”</p>

<p>Pablo was now sorely troubled in his mind
because he thought he might give offence to
the prince, and so he kept revolving in his mind
all that his mother had told him about the anger
of princes, and how much it was to be dreaded.
This thought so perplexed him that he resolved
on putting an end to the life of the cock that
had caused the mistake. He therefore proceeded
to the poultry-yard close by, and seeing
the offender surrounded by the hens, he made
a rush at him, which set all the fowls cackling
as if a fox had broken in.</p>

<p>The prince, hearing the noise, hurried to the
window, and in a loud voice inquired what the
noise was all about.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Pablo, “I was but trying to punish
the disturber of your rest. I have got hold of
him now, and your highness may go to sleep
without further care, as I will not forget to
waken you.”</p>

<p>“But,” continued the prince, “if you waken
me again before it is time, I will most decidedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>punish you.” Saying which he again retired to
rest.</p>

<p>“Since the days when cocks crew in the
Holy Land they have always brought sorrow
into this world,” inwardly ejaculated Pablo.
“His proper place is in the pan, and that is
where he should go if I had my way.”</p>

<p>All at once Pablo commenced to feel very
sleepy, so he walked up and down the yard to
keep awake; but becoming drowsy he sank on
the ground, and was soon so fast asleep that he
dreamt a nigger prince was attacking him,
which made him scream so terribly that it
woke, not only the prince, but also all the dogs
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The prince again rushed to the window, and
hearing Pablo scream out, “Don’t murder me,
I will give you all!” hurried down into the
yard, and seeing how matters stood bestowed
such a hearty kick on Pablo that he jumped
up.</p>

<p>The frightened barber beholding the prince
near to him, took to his heels, and ran home as
fast as he could.</p>

<p>When he had got into bed he began regretting
that he had run away from the prince’s service,
so he got up again, saying to himself, “The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>prince shall have a sharper spur than I could
ever buckle on;” and, proceeding to the principal
door of the palace, he wrote the following words
with chalk, “Pablo has gone before your highness
to court the Princess of Granada himself.”</p>

<p>This had the desired effect, for when the
prince arose in the morning and was leaving
the palace alone, he read the words, and they
caused him to be so jealous that he performed
the distance in half the time he would otherwise
have taken.</p>

<p>Pablo after that used to say that “a jealous
man on horseback is first cousin to a flash of
lightning and to a true Spaniard.”</p>

<h2><a name="Silver_Bells" id="Silver_Bells"></a><i>SILVER BELLS.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was in a lovely pine-wood that little Mirabella
wandered lonely and hungry. The
sand under her feet was very cool, and the
tufted pine-trees sheltered her from the fierce
rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Through an avenue of tall but bare pine-trees
she could see the big sea, which she
looked upon for the first time. Faint and
hungry as she was, she could not help wishing
to be nearer the waves; but she recollected
what her father had once told her, that little
children should be careful not to go too near
the sea when they are alone.</p>

<p>Her father, however, was dead. He was
King of the Silver Isles, and for his goodness
had been loved by all his subjects. Mirabella
was his only child; and her mother having
married again, she wanted to get rid of Mirabella,
so that her little boy Gliglu might inherit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the crown. So she ordered one of her servants
to lead Mirabella into the pine-wood far away
and leave her there, hoping the wolves would
find her and eat her.</p>

<p>When Mirabella was born, her aunt, who
was a fairy, gave her a silver bell, which she
tied around the child’s neck with a fairy chain
that could not be broken. In vain did her
mother try to take it from her; no scissors
could cut through it, and her strength could
not break it, so that wherever Mirabella went
the silver bell tinkled merrily.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that on the second night
on which she was out the silver bell tinkled
so loudly, that a wolf who happened to be
near, hearing it, approached her and said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Silver bell, silver bell, do not fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To obey you, Mirabella, I am here.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At first the little girl was very much afraid,
because she had heard of the cruelty of
wolves; but when he repeated the words, she
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. Wolf, if you would be so kind
as to bring me my mamma, I would be <i>so</i>
obliged.”</p>

<p>Off ran the wolf without saying another
word, and Mirabella commenced jumping for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>joy, causing her silver bell to tinkle more than
ever. A fox, hearing it, came up to her and
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Silver bell, silver bell, do not fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To obey you, Mirabella, I am here.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then she said, “Oh, dear Mr. Fox, I am <i>so</i>
hungry! I wish you would bring me something
to eat.”</p>

<p>Off went the fox, and in a short time he
returned with a roast fowl, bread, a plate,
knife, and fork, all nicely placed in a basket.
On the top of these things was a clean white
cloth, which she spread on the ground, and on
which she placed her dinner. She was indeed
thankful to the fox for his kindness, and patted
his head, which made him wag his thick brush.
She enjoyed her dinner very much; but she
was very thirsty. She thought she would try
tinkling her bell, and no sooner had she done
so than she heard the tinkling of another bell
in the distance, coming nearer and nearer
to her. She stood on tiptoe, and she saw a
stream of water flowing towards her, on which
floated a pretty canoe. When it got up to her
it stopped, and inside the canoe was a silver
mug; but on the bows of the canoe was hanging
a silver bell just like her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Silver bell, silver bell, do not fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thy mother comes, step in here.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So sang the canoe; but she could not understand
why she should get into the canoe if her
mother came, because she loved her mother,
and thought her mother loved her. Anyhow
she took hold of the mug, and, filling it with
water, drank it up. Water, which is always
the most refreshing of all drinks, was what the
tired little girl most needed, and as her father
had brought her up very carefully and properly,
she had never tasted anything stronger; but
her thirst made her enjoy the water more than
she ever had.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard some one screaming for
help, and the screams came nearer and nearer
to her. She turned round and saw the wolf
bearing her mother on his back, and however
much she tried to get off she could not, because
the wolf threatened to bite her. Springing up
to Mirabella’s side, the wolf said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Silver bell, silver bell, do not fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To obey you, Mirabella, I am here.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The wicked mother now jumped off his back,
and commenced scolding Mirabella for having
sent for her. She said that as soon as she
got back to the palace she would make a law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>that all the wolves should be killed, and that if
Mirabella ever dared return she should be
smothered. The poor little girl felt very
miserable, and was afraid that her mother
might kill her, so she stepped into the canoe,
and said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Bear me where my father dwells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tinkle, tinkle, silver bells.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The stream continued to flow, and as the
canoe moved on she saw her mother turned
into a cork-tree, and she bid good-bye to the
wolf and the fox. On sped the boat, and it
soon neared the big sea; but Mirabella felt no
fear, for the stream struck out across the ocean,
and the waves did not come near her. For
three days and nights the silver bells tinkled
and the canoe sped on; and when the morning
of the fourth day came, she saw that they were
approaching a beautiful island, on which were
growing many palm-trees, which are called
sacred palms. The grass was far greener than
any she had ever seen, for the sun was more
brilliant, but not so fierce, and when the canoe
touched the shore&mdash;oh, joy!&mdash;she saw her dear
father.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Silver bell, silver bell, do not fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To protect thee, Mirabella, I am here.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>She was <i>so</i> pleased to see her father again
and to hear him speak. It was so nice to be
loved, to be cared for, to be spoken kindly to.
Everything seemed to welcome her; the boughs
of the sacred palms waved in the summer
breeze, and the humming-birds, flitting about,
seemed like precious stones set in a glorious
blaze of light. Her father was not changed
very much; he looked somewhat younger and
stronger, and as he lifted her in his arms his
face seemed handsomer and his voice more
welcome. She felt no pang of sorrow, she had
no fears, for she was in her father’s arms, to
which the fairy silver bells had led her.</p>

<p>Farther up in the island she saw groups of
other children running to meet her, all with
silver bells around their necks; and some there
were among them whom she had known in the
Silver Islands. These had been playmates of
hers, but had left before her.</p>

<p>So periods of light sped on, in which joy
was her companion, when, looking into a deep
but very clear pond, she saw a gnarled cork-tree,
which seemed to have been struck by lightning.
Long did she stand there gazing into it wondering
where she had seen that tree. All at
once she spied a canoe passing close by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>tree, in which stood a young man, whom she
recognized as her step-brother Gliglu. He
seemed to cast a sorrowful look at the tree,
and then she recollected the fate of her mother.
At this moment her silver bell fell off, and,
sinking into the pond, it went down&mdash;down,
until it reached the tree, and, tinkling, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Take thy shape again, O queen!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then Mirabella saw her mother step into
the canoe; and tinkling bells in a short space
of time told her that others dear and near to
her had arrived, and, running down to the
shore, she cried out&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="King_Robin" id="King_Robin"></a><i>KING ROBIN.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was once a little boy called Sigli,
who, I am sorry to say, took great
pleasure in catching and killing little birds.
His father was a notorious robber, so it was
not surprising that Sigli gave way to acts of
cruelty. His mother died when he was little
more than a year old, and he did not know
any other relation. In the north of Portugal,
bands of robbers used to frequent the roads,
and some of them lived in strong castles, and
had a large retinue of followers. In time of
war these robber-chiefs would side with the
king’s party, because after the war was over
they received large grants of land for the
assistance they had rendered the sovereign.
Sometimes when the neighbouring kings of
Spain invaded Portugal, these robbers proved
of great advantage in repelling the invaders;
but in following up their victories they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>despoil all the churches in the enemy’s country
of the gold and silver idols, which the priests
had caused to be made in order to get the
ignorant peasantry to make offerings of money,
corn, and oil, in exchange for which the priests,
in the name of the idols, offered all those who
gave, pardon of their sins.</p>

<p>Now, Sigli’s father had on many occasions
robbed gold and silver idols, and had murdered
a few brethren of the Holy Inquisition, who,
in their turn, were well known for the wicked
deeds they had committed, such as burning
Christian men and women who did not, and
could not, profess the popish faith. But in
course of time the Jesuits, for so they were
called, made common cause against these
robbers, and either put them to death, or obliged
them to leave off robbing churches and take
to cheating the peasantry.</p>

<p>Sigli, as I said before, was a very cruel boy,
and he was the terror of all the birds and
beasts. He would lay traps for them, and
when he had caught them he would take
pleasure in tormenting them, which clearly
proved that he was not a Christian, nor
possessed of any refinement. But he took
more pleasure in catching Robin-redbreasts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>than in anything else, and for this purpose he
used bird-lime. He had caught and killed so
many that at last King Robin of Birdland issued
invitations to all his feathered subjects and to
the beasts of the field, asking them to a meeting
at which they might discuss the best means
of putting Sigli to death, or punishing him in
some other way, for the cruelty of which he
was guilty towards them.</p>

<p>Among the many who accepted the invitation
was an old fox, the first of the Reynards,
and when it came to his turn to speak, he said
that as Sigli was so fond of catching redbreasts
with bird-lime, he (Mr. Reynard) would propose
catching Sigli in the same manner; and
when caught they might discuss how they
should punish him, either by pecking and
biting him, or by getting the wolves to eat
him. In order to carry out this idea, he
suggested that the monkeys should be asked
to prepare the bird-lime, which they might use
with safety by oiling their hands, and then
gradually make a man of bird-lime close to the
robber chief’s castle. Sigli would probably
take it for some poor man, and hit it, and then
he would not be able to get away.</p>

<p>This idea was accepted by all in general, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>by Mrs. Queen Bee in particular, who owed
Sigli and his father a grudge for destroying her
hive; and the monkeys cheerfully set to work,
while King Robin watched the putting together
of the figure, and was very useful in giving it
most of the artistic merit it possessed when
finished. The making took one whole night, and
next morning, almost opposite the castle, stood
the bird-lime figure about the size of a man.</p>

<p>Sigli, seeing it from his dressing-room window,
and taking it for a beggar, was so enraged
that he ran out without his shoes and stockings,
and, without waiting to look at the man, he
struck at him with his right hand so that it
stuck firmly to the figure.</p>

<p>“Let go,” he cried, “or I will kick you!”
And as the figure did not let go he kicked it,
so that his foot was glued. “Let go my foot,”
he cried out, “or I will kick you with the
other;” and, doing so, both his legs were glued
to it. Then he knocked up against the figure,
and the more he did so the more firmly he
was glued.</p>

<p>Then his father, hearing his cries, rushed
out, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, you bad man! I will squeeze you to
death for hurting my dear Sigli!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>No sooner said than done, and the robber
chief was glued on to the bird-lime figure.</p>

<p>The screams of the two attracted the attention
of the servants, who, seeing their robber
master, as they thought, murdering his little
boy, ran away and never came back again.</p>

<p>King Robin was now master of the situation,
and he directed ten thousand bees under
General Bumble, and another ten thousand
wasps under Colonel Hornet, to fall on the
robber and cruel Sigli and sting them to death.
But this was hardly necessary, as the wriggling
of their bodies so fixed them to the figure that
they died of suffocation.</p>

<p>Then King Robin ordered the wolves to
dig a large grave, into which the monkeys
rolled Sigli, his father, and the bird-lime figure;
and after covering it up, they all took charge
of the castle, and lived there for many years
undisturbed, acknowledging King Robin as
their king; and if the Jesuits did not turn them
out, I am certain they are still there.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Wicked_King" id="The_Wicked_King"></a><i>THE WICKED KING.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was once a king who was so wicked
that he would not allow any widows to
live in his kingdom, because he was certain that
they had caused the death of their husbands;
nor would he admit of any fat man or woman,
as he was afraid that they would eat up everything
in the kingdom.</p>

<p>He was also very proud and arrogant, and
if any man happened to be taller than himself,
he would give him the choice of being lowered
to a proper height by either having his head
or his legs cut off.</p>

<p>His subjects were so afraid of him and of
his laws, that the married women would not
let their husbands go out of their sight, lest
any harm should happen to them, and if they
turned at all pale, or had broken sleep, or had
lost their appetites, they would nurse them
night and day. So afraid were they of becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>widows that they always agreed with their
husbands on all points, lest by disagreeing they
should bring about an attack of indigestion,
or something worse that might produce death.</p>

<p>And when their children commenced to
grow rapidly, their fears were doubled lest
they should become taller than the king; for
if they fed them on pudding, which does not
promote growth, they incurred the danger of
their becoming fat; and if they fed them on
meat, so as to make them lean, they would
probably grow tall.</p>

<p>It very soon became evident that there were
more hunchbacks in that country than in any
other; for as soon as the children were
approaching the forbidden height, their parents
would suspend heavy weights from their
shoulders, so that their backs became rounded
and eventually humped.</p>

<p>The young men, when they were at an age
to marry, found it very difficult to get any
woman to have them, because they were afraid
of becoming widows, and also because so many
of the men were humpbacked.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding the king’s wickedness,
it was admitted by the married men that their
condition had considerably improved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>There was a wide road made round the
cities and towns, on which all who were inclined
to be stout, both men and women, would run
until they were out of breath, and jump over
hurdles; and there were so many of these
people that the revenues of the Church commenced
to suffer, owing to the decreased
demand for “bulls,” as they willingly imposed
long fasts on themselves.</p>

<p>Now, in the chief city of this country there
was a very wise man, well versed in the law
and in concocting drugs, for he was the public
executioner and the chemist of the place. To
him, therefore, went a deputation of the people
to lay their grievances before him; and after
the spokesman had finished what he had to
say, the executioner looked very wise, and,
after considering awhile, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Our king’s predecessor was held to be just
and generous because he allowed every man to
retain a fifth of his produce for the maintenance
of his family, and the tax he imposed on this
fifth part was always readily paid.” Here he
touched the edge of his sharp axe and smiled;
and the deputation exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Quite right; so it was.”</p>

<p>“Now, the present king,” continued the wise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>man, again feeling the edge of his axe, “has
magnanimously increased your loyal tribute to
him by one part in a hundred of the produce
of the land, and yet you are not satisfied!”</p>

<p>“The king’s generosity we all feel,” said the
deputation; “but, if we may be allowed to
express an opinion to you, sir, we would&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Certainly you may,” interrupted the man of
drugs, running his hand quickly over the axe&mdash;“certainly
you may; why should you not?”</p>

<p>By this time the chief spokesman had got
behind the others, and it was very evident
that the members of the deputation were
becoming aware that the logic of the executioner
was too sharp for them.</p>

<p>Seeing that they were all silent, the executioner
went on to say that the king had, in his
opinion, been extremely considerate; for he
had, by the law against widows, contributed to
the happiness and long life of the husbands;
and, by enacting that no man should exceed a
certain height or stoutness, they had economized
in many ways, for they ate less, and their
clothes would cost them less. In fact, he saw
no reason for dissatisfaction; but as they had
come to him as a deputation, he felt it to be his
duty to place their supposed grievances before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>the king, and he, the executioner, felt certain
that the king would reply to them in a suitable
manner. And having said this he raised the
axe to the light to see that there was no notch
on the edge, which caused the deputation to
tremble most violently, and to assure the executioner
that they were perfectly satisfied, and
desired to withdraw.</p>

<p>The executioner, however, would not allow
them to retire&mdash;for the grievances of a people
should not be withheld from the king’s ear;
but the members of the deputation became so
frightened that they made their escape through
the windows as fast as they could. And when
the king heard all about it he remarked that
“Folly had entered with dignity by the door,
and Wisdom had unceremoniously escaped
through the window.”</p>

<h2><a name="The_Palace" id="The_Palace"></a><i>THE PALACE OF THE ENCHANTED
MOORS.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">O</span>verlooking</span> the river Douro, close
to Freixo, are some huge rocks, situated
on the brink of an almost perpendicular eminence.
To this spot do congregate, so it is
reported, the souls of unbaptized children, who
make the midnight hour hideous with their
shrieks when the tempest is hurrying down
through the valley and over the snow-capped
hills. When the wind is at its highest do these
souls of the lost utter their weird shrieks, so
nigh akin unto the howling of the wind that
only the neighbouring villagers pretend to be
able to distinguish between the clamouring
voices of the unbaptized and the howling
caused by the fitful gusts of the wintry blast
as it rushes impetuously among the rocks and
down the precipices.</p>

<p>On such nights will the farmer’s wife light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>the tapers around the image of good St. Laurence,
patron of the winds, and calling her
household around her, the following verses are
intoned&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Good St. Laurence, keep us free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the sin of heresy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lull the angry winds to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still be thou our honoured guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">By our fathers prized.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Drive all goblins from our door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those whom Heaven doth ignore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Witches, demons, bogeys all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May they sink and may they fall<br /></span>
<span class="i8">With the unbaptized.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At times it takes longer to appease the wrath
of St. Laurence than at others; but with daylight
the courage of the worshippers revives,
and the souls of the unbaptized seek rest,
although the winds may continue to howl.</p>

<p>Many centuries ago the palace of the now
enchanted Moors at Freixo was the glory of
the place. Although considerably smaller, it
was after the style of the Alhambra, at Granada;
but it was held in almost greater esteem than
the principal residence of the Moorish kings,
for in a magnificent stable was lodged the ass
on which the prophet Mohamed was supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>to have ascended to Paradise. It seems that
the chosen quadruped, unaccustomed to the
pastures of the Mohamedan Paradise, had
escaped, and descended on earth close to the
palace, or alcazar, at Freixo, where he was
found one morning by the dwellers when they
were on their way to the mosque.</p>

<p>He was a fine specimen of an ass, and
worthy of the Mohamedan creed. Tradition
hints at a miller having laid claim to him; but
as he could offer no proofs why the ass should
not have been in Paradise, and seeing that the
ass was as white as the prophet’s, the miller
was ordered to look for his donkey elsewhere,
as this was the ass of the prophet.</p>

<p>How long this favoured quadruped lived is
not recorded, but no doubts have been raised
as to his eventual demise; and he, too, was
heard braying furiously from his resting-place
when the winds blew high.</p>

<p>But few vestiges are now left of this once
splendid alcazar. Time defied its ornamental
turrets and richly chased walls, and levelled
them with the ground. Only the surrounding
rocks have remained, and with them many
traditions. These the inhabitants of the district
have preserved intact, or maybe added to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>interest by investing them with a semblance to
truth which renders them all the more worthy
of preservation, as being stepping-stones carrying
us back to a long past.</p>

<p>But even where such doubtful lore holds the
people in awe, a few may be found who,
although rejecting that part of the tradition
which is evidently but the fruit of a fertile
imagination, or of religious fanaticism, recognize
in these legends the preservation of a still
unwritten history, to whose identification with
facts the ruins of many a Moslem building of
rare architectural beauty attest.</p>

<p>And if, after many a sanguinary fight, the
Cross was victorious over the Crescent, the
Christian population of the Iberic Peninsula
must admit that the faint vestiges of beauty in
their architecture of to-day have an Arabic
origin; that to their Moorish conquerors they
owe much of the daring and endurance which
characterized the generation of great navigators,
as also to them was due the introduction of
many of the useful arts and sciences.</p>

<p>The traveller will now look in vain for the
alcazar of El Rachid at Freixo. The mighty
rocks alone mark the spot, and naught remains
of art to please the eye. Traditionary lore may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>interest him, but he must be ready to listen to
it with all the additions which a gross superstition
can alone invent or believe.</p>

<p>Here, then, is it recorded that Al Rachid
held a Christian maiden captive for many years.
That she was as good as she was beautiful goes
without further remark. Maria das Dores, for
so she is named by her chroniclers, was one
of those splendid women worthy to be the
mothers of that succeeding generation of heroes
who overthrew the Moors on the plains of
Ourique.</p>

<p>Maria was the daughter of a very wealthy
farmer who resided close to the mouth of the
river Minho. It was her duty to work with
the farm labourers in the field, and she would
mingle her sweet voice with theirs when singing
hymns to the Virgin as they plied their
hoes.</p>

<p>Often had Al Rachid seen her at work from
his hiding-place in a neighbouring forest. He
loved the maiden, although he had reason to
believe she was a Christian; but he knew that
she had given her love to another, and could,
therefore, not be his unless he took her by
force.</p>

<p>One day, at vesper-time, she did not return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>to the farm with the labourers. Search was
made for her everywhere, but she could not
be found. Then it was imagined she might
be in conversation with her lover; but, on
inquiry, he had not seen her.</p>

<p>Mounted parties scoured the country all
around, but in vain; she had not been seen,
and there was no doubt entertained but that
she had been lured into the forest, and become
the captive of Al Rachid.</p>

<p>But, then, nobody had seen the Moorish chief
that day. True; but the Moors were enchanters,
and it was known that they could make subterranean
passages which closed behind them
so as to prevent their being pursued.</p>

<p>The wise woman of the district was therefore
called into requisition, and she, having
consulted the astrolabe and made a fire of pine
needles, discovered the direction in which the
fugitives were going. Mounting their horses,
and led by the wise woman, who bestrode a
splendid white mule, they galloped off, and
after two days’ hard riding they distinctly heard
the sound of a horse’s hoofs, but they could not
see the horse.</p>

<p>Then they knew that Al Rachid was making
use of the enchanted passage which they could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>not hope to find, and they had to content themselves
with following the sound until they came
within sight of Al Rachid’s palace.</p>

<p>They were now in the enemy’s country, and
with their little force they could not successfully
besiege the palace, so, much against their will,
they returned home.</p>

<p>There was only one means of rescuing the
captive maiden, and this would take time. No
Christian man or woman could gain admittance
to the enchanted passage, and no Moslem could
be found willing to attempt the rescue. Therefore
they hit upon a plan of securing the services
of a heretic. A child had been born in the
village, and him, it was resolved, they should
not baptize. When old enough, he should be
entrusted with the task of rescue, and being
unbaptized he would gain admittance to all the
enchanted places.</p>

<p>Years rolled by, and the youth had attained
the age of thirteen, when he was informed of
the mission on which it was intended to send
him. Being of a daring disposition, he courted
danger, and buckling on his sword, and bearing
his shield, he left the farmer’s house; and,
accompanied by the wise woman, he directed
his steps to the forest. When the two had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>reached an old oak-tree, the wise woman
repeated the following words three times&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here stands an unbaptized<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thread the subterranean way;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">and then she knocked with her staff three times
on the ground, which opened, and the youthful
heretic boldly descended, the earth closing
above him. Before him was a magnificent
display of jewels studding the walls on each
side, whose brilliancy at first dazzled him.
Getting more accustomed to the strong light,
he discovered a coal-black horse, fully caparisoned,
standing by his side, as if ready for him
to mount; but he was not to be tempted, for
he would rather trust to his legs than to a
strange horse. Then when he had walked
some distance he came to a river, on which
there was a boat rowed by six lovely maidens,
who asked him to get in, and they would row
him across. But he would not be tempted,
and he boldly waded the stream and crossed
over. Having proceeded a little further, however,
he heard the piteous cry of a child, and,
hastening forward, he saw a lovely little boy,
dressed in the Oriental fashion, who besought
him, with tears in his eyes, to carry him a little
way, for he was very tired and had still a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>way to go. He could not refuse him, and,
stooping slightly, raised him in his arms; but
no sooner had he done so, than this little boy
turned into a giant, who, twining his arms
around the heretic’s neck, would have strangled
him, but that, being unbaptized, he could not be
killed. After many attempts to strangle the
intruder the giant relaxed his hold, and as
suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>The heretic, after a time, came to a standstill,
for he was confronted by total darkness.
Nothing daunted, however, he drew his sword
and hit out, so that the blade, striking against
the sides of the passage, caused the jewels to
emit sparks, and these lit up thousands of lamps.
In the distance he saw two enormous tigers,
each having two heads. They seemed to be
ready to tear him to pieces, but, on observing
him advance sword in hand, they ran away.</p>

<p>At the end of the third day he had walked
so quickly that he stood before the secret
entrance to the alcazar of Al Rachid. The
ponderous gates were wide open, but he could
not enter because of an enormous frog that
blocked up the way, and emitted flames of fire
from its mouth and eyes. Do what he could,
there was no getting near the hideous creature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>He had recourse to stratagem, and, pretending
not to be afraid of the animal, he threw his
sword over the frog’s back, exclaiming, “Take
that; I fear thee not!”</p>

<p>The frog, turning to get hold of the sword,
offered an opportunity to the heretic of jumping
on its back, which he did, and, digging his spurs
into its sides, he obliged it to advance, when,
as it passed by his sword, he dexterously picked
it up, and was not at all particular how he
used it about the creature’s head.</p>

<p>The more he struck at the frog, the more
fierce were the flames of fire it emitted; and
Al Rachid, hearing the noise, hurried to the
entrance to see what was the matter, when he
found himself enveloped in flames which the
heretic forced the frog to throw out until
the cruel Moor was completely burned.</p>

<p>Then at one stroke he cut off the animal’s
head, and at the same moment the castle
vanished, and where it had previously stood
the heretic found Maria, the farmer’s daughter,
who was overjoyed at her deliverance.</p>

<p>The two wended their way back to their
native village, where great rejoicings awaited
them; and seeing that the services of the heretic
would in all probability no longer be required,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>he was baptized with as little delay as possible,
and for the rescue he had effected the rich
farmer amply rewarded him, while the Church
accorded him plenary absolution for his past
heresy.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Seven_Pigeons" id="The_Seven_Pigeons"></a><i>THE SEVEN PIGEONS.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> a deserted part of the rock-bound
Cantabrian coast, a poor fisherman,
named Pedro, discovered a lovely maiden,
magnificently dressed, combing her long jet-black
hair with a golden comb studded with
diamonds.</p>

<p>It was still early morning, and the sun had
not attained its greatest power; and as the tide
was at its lowest, an innumerable number of
ponds were formed by the rocks which, for a
distance of half a mile, were left bare by the
receding sea.</p>

<p>Seated near to one of these ponds, and cooling
her feet in the water, sat this lovely maiden;
and she was so intent on performing her toilet
that she did not perceive Pedro, who, thinking
she was a mermaid, and might therefore cast a
spell over him, hid behind a ledge of rocks, and
was able to see and hear her without being
seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>Pedro heard her singing the following
words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I am daughter of a king<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who rules in Aragon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My messengers they bring<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Me food to live upon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father thinks me dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My death he did ordain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that I would not wed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A wicked knight of Spain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But those whom he did send<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To kill me in this place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My youth they did befriend,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But cruel is my case.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Is it even so,” said Pedro to himself, “that
this lovely maiden is the daughter of a king?
If I render her assistance I may incur great
danger, and if I leave her to die it will be a
crying shame; what, then, am I to do?”</p>

<p>As he was thus pondering in his mind, he
heard a flapping of wings, and, looking in the
direction whence the noise came, he saw a pair
of perfectly white pigeons bearing a small
basket between them, strung on a thin golden
bar, which they held at each end between their
beaks.</p>

<p>Descending, they deposited the basket by
the side of the princess, who caressed them
most tenderly, and then took from the basket
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>some articles of food which she greedily ate
(for she had not eaten since the previous
morning), and after having finished the contents
she again sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I am daughter of a king,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who thinks that I am dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on this beach I sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By pigeons I am fed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thank you, my pretty birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who are so kind to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what avail my words?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, I a bird would be!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This wish was no sooner uttered than Pedro,
much to his astonishment, saw that the lovely
princess had been turned into a white swan,
with a small gold crown on the top of its
head.</p>

<p>Expanding her wings, she gradually rose high
above him, attended by the pigeons, and all
three flew out to sea; when suddenly Pedro
observed a magnificent ship not far from the
coast, whose deck was of burnished gold, and
her sides of ivory fastened with golden nails.
The ropes were of thread of silver, and the
sails of white silk, while the masts and yards
were made of the finest sandal-wood.</p>

<p>To the ship the three birds flew, and no
sooner did they alight on the deck than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>Pedro observed that they were three beautiful
maidens.</p>

<p>The princess sat on a richly ornamented
chair, and the other two maidens on velvet
cushions embroidered in gold at her feet.</p>

<p>Over them was spread a superb awning to
shelter them from the rays of the sun, and the
vessel glided about over the vast expanse of
water, now in one direction, now in another,
as if the breeze blew to suit the sails.</p>

<p>Pedro was so astonished at what he saw
that at last he got frightened, and, being
young and nimble, he soon lost sight of the
ship; but at every pace he seemed to hear a
voice saying, “Run not away, future king of
Aragon!”</p>

<p>Pedro continued running till he left the
beach far behind, and was now in the pine-forest;
nor did he stop till he was in the densest
part, when, for very fatigue, he threw himself
on the ground, and then he distinctly heard a
voice say, “Pedro, you are destined to be
King of Aragon; but tell no one.”</p>

<p>Not till then had he discovered that he was
no longer dressed in fisherman’s attire, but
that his clothes were of the finest cloth fringed
with gold lace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Pedro, on seeing this, said, “I am enchanted.
That princess is indeed a mermaid, and has cast
a spell over me. I am undone, my eyes deceive
me, and what I take for so much grandeur is
but a deception.” Saying which, he started to
his feet, and hurried towards his village as fast
as his legs would carry him.</p>

<p>Arrived at the fishing hamlet, all his old
companions paid him such deference that he
tried to get out of their way, thinking they did
but laugh at him, and, arriving at the door of
his widowed mother’s cottage, he ran into the
kitchen. His mother happened to be frying
some fish, and when she saw a grand gentleman
enter the apartment she took the pan off the
fire, and, bowing low, said, “My noble sir, this
house is too humble for such as you; allow me
to conduct you to his reverence’s house, for
there you will find accommodation more suited
to your high estate.”</p>

<p>Pedro would have replied to his mother, and
sought to kiss her hand and ask her blessing,
after the custom of the country; but, on attempting
to speak, his tongue hung out of his mouth,
and he made so strange a noise and so gesticulated
that his mother was glad to get out of
the house, followed, however, by her son and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>a large crowd of villagers who had congregated
to see the grand stranger.</p>

<p>As soon as it was known throughout the
village of the arrival of the grand stranger the
church bells pealed, and the parish priest
mingled with the crowd desirous of seeing the
new arrival; but as soon as Pedro commenced
gesticulating as before, the priest and all the
rest of the people were much frightened, for
they thought that he was dangerously mad.</p>

<p>Pedro, noticing this, sorrowfully turned away
from his native village and took the high-road
to the next town.</p>

<p>As he was going along, thinking of his
present trouble, he observed a wide gate made
of gold, opening into a beautiful garden, into
which he hesitated not to enter; for he recollected
what the wise woman of the village had
once told him&mdash;that “grand clothes beget
respect.”</p>

<p>“Open wide those gates, O worker midst
the flowers,” exclaimed Pedro to an old gardener
(for he had now recovered his speech). “I
come in cloth of gold to speak unto my love.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” replied the old man, “you may always
enter here, for you are D. Pedro of Aragon,
I well can see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>“What very high balconies, a hundred feet in
height!” exclaimed Pedro. “Tell me, good old
man, does the princess ever come there?”</p>

<p>“To those balconies so high, to feel the
cooling breeze,” replied the gardener, “the
princess comes there every evening alone.”</p>

<p>“Should she ask you,” continued Pedro,
“who I am, tell her that I am your son come
from a distant land, and I will help you to water
the pinks.”</p>

<p>At her usual time the princess came to her
favourite balcony, and seeing Pedro watering
the flowers, she beckoned to him, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“O waterer of the pinks, come a little
nearer and speak to me.”</p>

<p>“Is it true that you desire to speak to me?”
inquired Pedro of the princess.</p>

<p>“No mirror bright ever reflected the truth
more correctly than the words I uttered conveyed
my desire,” answered the princess.</p>

<p>“Here, then, you have me,” said Pedro.
“Order me as your slave; but give me, for I
am thirsty, a small ewer of water.”</p>

<p>The princess poured some water into a silver
goblet, and having handed it to Pedro, he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“And in this mirror bright of crystal water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>pure, which does reflect thy form, I quench my
heart’s deep thirst.”</p>

<p>“You see yonder palace at the end of the
garden,” said the princess to Pedro. “Well, in
that palace you will be lodged for the night;
but should you ever tell any one what you see
there, you will put yourself in danger and cause
me great trouble.”</p>

<p>Pedro promised to keep secret whatever he
might see that night, and bidding “good night”
to the princess, he hastened to the palace which
the princess had pointed out to him, and, having
entered it, he walked through the marble passage,
which seemed to be interminable. On each
side of him were rows of majestic columns,
surmounted by gold capitals, and now and
again he thought he saw the forms of lovely
young maidens flitting among the columns.</p>

<p>Just as he was approaching a richly carved
fountain surrounded by sacred palms, a maiden
of surprising beauty seemed to be addressing
a Moor in most impassioned tones, as if claiming
his indulgence; but when Pedro got up to them
he discovered that both were the work of the
statuary.</p>

<p>At every step the surroundings became more
magnificent, and the carved ceiling was of such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>exquisite workmanship that it seemed rather
the work of the loom, being so like the finest
lace, than of the sculptor.</p>

<p>At last he arrived at the end of this avenue
of columns, and noticing a door in front of him,
he opened it, and found himself standing on a
marble quay, against which the sea waves were
washing.</p>

<p>Scanning the vast expanse of water before
him, he observed approaching him the same
beautiful ship he had seen in the morning.</p>

<p>When the ship came alongside the quay, a
sailor sprung on shore, and made her fast by
a golden cable; then, addressing Pedro, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am glad you have not kept us waiting,
for our royal mistress is very wishful to consult
you, as one of her favourite doves has broken
its right wing, and if you cannot cure it, the
princess will die of starvation.”</p>

<p>Pedro made no reply, but stepped on board
the ship, which soon got under way, and within
a short time they were approaching the coast
he knew so well.</p>

<p>Having landed, Pedro saw the princess
seated on the sand, nursing one of her white
pigeons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>“Pedro of Aragon,” the princess exclaimed,
“a stranger dared to enter my royal father’s
garden, and in assisting to water the pinks he
trod on the wing of my favourite pigeon, and
he has broken it.”</p>

<p>“Señora,” replied Pedro, “the intruder did
probably seek you, and had no idea of hurting
the lovely bird.”</p>

<p>“That matters not,” continued the princess,
“for my principal supporter is wounded, and you
must cure her. Cut out my heart, and steep
this bird in my warm blood, and when I am
dead throw my body into the sea.”</p>

<p>“How can I kill one so lovely?” asked
Pedro. “I would rather die myself than hurt
you!”</p>

<p>“Then you do not care for me, or else you
would do as I bid you,” answered the princess.</p>

<p>“Princess, I cannot and will not kill you;
but I will do anything else you bid me,” said
Pedro.</p>

<p>“Well, then, since you will not kill me, I
order you to take this pigeon back with you;
for I know it was you who walked in my
father’s garden to-day,” continued the princess.
“And to-morrow evening, when you see that
princess whom you saw to-day, you must kill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>her, and let her blood fall over this pretty
bird.”</p>

<p>Pedro was now in great trouble, for he had
promised the princess to do anything she told
him to do, except killing her, and he could not
break his word; so taking hold of the pigeon
very gently, and bidding good-bye to the
princess, he again stepped on board the ship,
and so depressed was he that he had arrived
at the marble quay without being aware of it.</p>

<p>On landing, he retraced his steps through
the avenue of pillars, and found himself once
more in the garden, where the old gardener was
again watering the pinks.</p>

<p>“What very high balconies!” exclaimed
Pedro. “Tell me, old gardener of the ancient
times, if the princess comes here to-day.”</p>

<p>“The princess loves the fresh sea-breeze,”
answered the old man, “and to-night she will
come to the balcony, for her noble lover will be
waiting for her.”</p>

<p>“And who is the princess’s lover?” inquired
Pedro.</p>

<p>“If you will help me to water the pinks, I
will tell you,” said the old man.</p>

<p>Pedro readily acquiesced, and putting down
the pigeon where he thought no harm would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>happen to it, he commenced assisting the
gardener to water the pinks.</p>

<p>After a silence of a few minutes the gardener
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“There were once seven pigeons who said,
‘Seven pigeons are we, and with other seven
pigeons we might all be mated; but, as it is,
we must remain seven pigeons.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in Pedro; “but I want to know
who the princess’s lover is.”</p>

<p>The old man took no heed of the interruption,
and continued&mdash;</p>

<p>“There were once seven pigeons who said,
‘Seven pigeons are we&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried Pedro; “I will have no such
idle talk. Tell me who this noble lover is, or
I will do you an injury.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” cried the gardener, with a very serious
countenance, “there were once seven pigeons
who said, ‘Seven pigeons are we, and&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Take your watering-can,” shouted Pedro in
disgust; “I will not listen to your nonsense!”</p>

<p>“And yet there were once seven pigeons
who said, ‘Seven pigeons are we;’ and now the
last of them is gone, for the noble lover has
been false to his trust,” exclaimed the old man,
looking very cunningly at Pedro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>At these words Pedro looked towards the
place where he had placed the pigeon, and it
was no longer there.</p>

<p>Seized with a fit of fury, he was about to lay
hands on the gardener, when, to his astonishment,
he found that he was also gone.</p>

<p>“I am undone,” cried the unhappy Pedro;
“and now I shall not see the princess again.”
Saying which he fainted away, and might probably
have remained there some time, but that
he heard a voice saying, in a jocular manner&mdash;</p>

<p>“There were once seven pigeons who said,
‘Seven pigeons are we, and&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>Pedro started to his feet, and close to him
was standing the princess whom he had previously
seen in the balcony.</p>

<p>“Why do you thus tease me, princess?”
said Pedro. “I want to hear no more about the
seven horrid pigeons.”</p>

<p>“Don Pedro de Aragon,” answered the princess,
“I must tell you that the old gardener to
whom you spoke is a magician, and he has
possessed himself of the last means I had of
regaining my liberty, for I am under his power.
Is it not true that you came here with the purpose
of killing me?”</p>

<p>“I was under a vow to do so,” replied Pedro;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>“but I cannot kill you, although I would rather
slay you, fair princess, than do you a more
grievous injury.”</p>

<p>“Go back, then, to the unhappy lady whom
you left on the sea-shore, and tell her that you
have been false to your promises,” said the
princess.</p>

<p>“How sorry I am,” exclaimed Pedro, “that
I was ever destined to be King of Aragon!
When I was a poor fisherman, I was far happier
than I am now!”</p>

<p>“Pedro of Aragon, the moon will be at the
full to-night, and you may then rescue me,” said
the princess, “if you have the courage to meet
the wicked magician in this garden at midnight,
for then is his power weakest.”</p>

<p>“I am prepared for the worst,” replied Pedro,
“and I fear not your gaoler.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” continued the princess, “when
the magician sees you he will again tell you
about the seven pigeons; but when he has
finished, you must tell him that there were once
seven wives who had only one husband, and
that they are waiting outside to see him. Do
as I tell you, and if you are not afraid of his
anger, you may be able to free me.”</p>

<p>Pedro promised to do as he was told, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>the princess having retired into the palace,
Pedro amused himself by walking under the
lofty balconies, watching the fire-flies grow
brighter as night came on.</p>

<p>Just about midnight the magician was seen
watering the pinks, and as soon as he perceived
Pedro he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“There were once seven pigeons who said,
‘Seven pigeons are we, and with other seven
pigeons we might all be mated; but, as it is,
we must remain seven pigeons.’”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” put in Pedro. “And once upon a
time there were seven wives who had only one
husband, and they are waiting outside to see
him.”</p>

<p>The magician, at these words, lost all control
over his temper; but Pedro heeded him not,
rather did he endeavour to increase his rage by
repeating all about the seven wives.</p>

<p>“I am undone!” cried the magician; “but if
you will induce the spirits of my seven wives
to again seek the grave, I will give you what
you want, and that is the princess.”</p>

<p>“Give me the princess first,” answered Pedro,
“and then I will free you of your wives.”</p>

<p>“Take her, then,” said the magician; “here
she is. And forget not what you have promised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>me, for I may tell you in confidence that a man
with seven wives cannot play the magician.”</p>

<p>Pedro hurried away with the princess; and
after they had been married and crowned, the
princess, who was now queen, one day said to
him&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pedro, the magician who held me captive
from you was Rank, and therefore were the
balconies so high. When you saw me on the
beach fed by pigeons, it was that you should
know my power; on the shore I was attended
by winged messengers, and on the sea I sailed
about at pleasure.”</p>

<p>“But what about the wounded pigeon?”
asked Pedro.</p>

<p>“Recollect, Pedro, what you said to me in
the garden,” answered the princess&mdash;“that you
would rather slay me than do me a more
grievous injury. That poor pigeon with its
broken wing could no more hope to soar aloft
than an injured woman to mix with her former
associates.”</p>

<p>“And what about the seven wives who were
waiting outside, and who so frightened the old
magician, Rank?” continued Pedro.</p>

<p>“They are the seven deadly sins, who would
each have a tongue for itself, and yet without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>tongues are enough to frighten Rank,” answered
the princess.</p>

<p>“And who am I, then,” asked Pedro, “to be
so exalted now?”</p>

<p>“You are the wise man who strove to do his
best, yet tried not to exalt himself above his
position,” sweetly answered the princess.</p>

<p>“So that the magician Rank has unwillingly
raised the poor fisherman to be king,” whispered
Pedro.</p>

<p>“Not Rank alone, but much more so thy
own worth.”</p>

<p class="subheader">TRANSLATION.</p>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ady Clare</span> was in her garden overlooking
the sea. It was a summer’s day,
and the many coloured butterflies flitted about
under the trees and among the sweet smelling
flowers.</p>

<p>Lady Clare was combing her golden tresses
with an ivory comb, seated on a crimson velvet
cushion. She looked towards the sea, and she
saw a gallant fleet making for the land.</p>

<p>He who was in command stepped on shore.
He was a belted knight, but his features could
not be seen as his vizor was down.</p>

<p>Approaching Lady Clare, he saluted her,
and she thus addressed him&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hast thou, noble knight, seen my husband,
who bid me good-bye many years ago when he
sailed for the Holy Land?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>“I know not thy husband, fair lady. By what
should I know him?”</p>

<p>“He took his white charger with its golden
trappings with him,” answered Lady Clare.
“On his lance he bore a red pennon; a tress
of my hair served him for a belt, from which
hung his sword. But if thou hast not seen him,
Knight of the Cross, then woe be to me, lonely
widow, for I have three daughters, and they are
all unmarried.”</p>

<p>“I am a soldier,” continued the knight; “war
is my employment. But what wouldst thou
give, fair lady, to have thy husband near?”</p>

<p>“I would give thee more money than thou
couldst count, as well as the roof of my house,
which is made of gold and ivory,” answered
Lady Clare.</p>

<p>“I care not for gold nor money; they are of
no use to me, for I am a soldier and engaged
in war, and I never saw thy husband. But
what wouldst thou give, fair lady, to have him
here?” inquired the knight.</p>

<p>“I would give thee my jewels, which cannot
be weighed nor measured; I would give thee
my golden loom and my distaff of burnished
silver,” said Lady Clare.</p>

<p>“I neither wish for gold nor for silver: with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>steel is my hand better acquainted, for I am
a warrior, and I never saw thy husband. But
what wouldst thou give to have him near
thee?” cried the knight.</p>

<p>“I would let thee choose one of my daughters;
they are as fair as the moon, or as the sun
when rising,” urged Lady Clare.</p>

<p>“I do not want thy daughters; they may not
marry me, for I am a soldier and engaged in
warfare, and I never cast eyes on thy husband.
But what wouldst thou give to have thy own
knight here?” exclaimed the warrior.</p>

<p>“I cannot give thee more, nor hast thou
more to ask of me,” replied Lady Clare.</p>

<p>“Thou hast still more to give, for thou hast
not yet offered thyself, fair lady,” said the
knight.</p>

<p>“A belted knight who dare so speak deserves
to be dragged around my garden, tied
to the tails of my horses. Come hither, my
vassals, and punish this rude soldier!” exclaimed
Lady Clare.</p>

<p>“Do not call for thy vassals, for they are
mine also,” said the knight; “and do not be
angry with me, for I have already kissed
thee.”</p>

<p>“Then thou art surely my brave lord,” said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>Lady Clare; “but how wilt thou prove thyself?”</p>

<p>“By the golden ring with seven gems which
I divided with thee when I left,” answered the
knight. “Here is my half; where is thine?”</p>

<p>“My daughters,” cried the Lady Clare,
“bring hither my half of the ring, for your
father is here to claim it! But, oh, my husband,
joy at seeing thee again had nigh made thee
a widower.”</p>

<h2><a name="Good_St_James" id="Good_St_James"></a><i>GOOD ST. JAMES, AND THE
MERRY BARBER OF COMPOSTELLA.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ust</span> close to the cathedral of Compostella
lived a barber whose real name was Pedro
Moreno, but who was better known by that of
El Macho, “the mule,” because he was so stubborn
that if he happened to be playing the guitar,
he would not leave off though a dozen customers
were waiting to be shaved. But in Spain
a barber also applies leeches, draws teeth, and
extracts corns, so that it was very annoying
for a man who was suffering from tooth-ache,
and wanted his tooth taken out or stopped, to
have to wait until the barber had finished
playing on the guitar.</p>

<p>He was also a soothsayer, and could repeat
the whole of the prophetical <i>Buena Dicha</i> by
heart. He was, in fact, the most useful man
in Compostella, and had cultivated the art of
shaving the face and head from the commencement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>which consists in watching the flies when
standing close to the master who is showing off
his skill on a customer, to being able to play
the guitar with such proficiency that, holding
the neck in his left hand and pressing the cords
with the fingers, he shall, by thumping the
instrument on the big toe of his left foot, cause
it to vibrate the air of the immortal <i>Cachucha</i>
or the <i>Bolero</i>, while with his right hand he
plays the castanets.</p>

<p>A barber may have his brass chin-basins,
which hang outside the door, burnished every
day; his fly-catcher renovated every month; his
bottles containing leeches nice and clean; and
he may know all the scandal of the town, which
is decidedly a part of his duty; but if he cannot
play the guitar and the castanets at the same
time&mdash;which he can only do by calling the big
toe of his left foot into requisition&mdash;he must not
be considered a barber of the first class. He
may do for shaving poor priests and water-carriers;
but he may not shave an abbot, nor
an archbishop, still less a grandee of Spain, who
may sit before the king with his hat on.</p>

<p>In other countries the position of a barber is
somewhat less important than it used to be
when cleanliness required of a man that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>should appear at early mass on the Sunday
well shaved; but in Spain, cleanliness of the
face is a great recommendation, for a rough
chin never earned kisses. Therefore is a barber
still held in great respect in the land of the
Cid; and although Don Pedro Moreno was
known by the name of “El Macho,” no one
would have dared address him thus.</p>

<p>One day the archbishop called on El Macho
to request of him to come and look at the
image of St. James in the cathedral, to whom
the edifice is dedicated, because this miraculous
figure, who had wrought so many miracles, had,
strange to say, commenced letting his beard
grow, much to the astonishment of all the
priesthood and of the common people, and to
the dismay of several knights who had been
knighted at the altar of St. James, because in
those days knights did not use beards.</p>

<p>The barber, seeing the archbishop enter his
house, advanced, knelt, and kissed his ring;
and, knowing on what errand he was come, he
was so solicitous of securing the archbishop’s
favour, that he put aside his guitar, and respectfully
awaited the prelate’s commands.</p>

<p>The archbishop having informed Pedro of
the state of St. James’s chin, proceeded to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>inform him that it had been decided, at a
meeting of the clergy, to entrust the shaving of
the saint to him, Pedro Moreno; but that, as
this growth of hair was most exceptional, seeing
that the image was of wood, it was probable
that the usual process of shaving might not be
sufficient.</p>

<p>“And you are quite right, most excellent sir,
in your supposition,” exclaimed the barber; “for
unless I obtain some of the holy water in which
the good saint was baptized, and a piece of
the soap with which Judas Iscariot greased the
rope with which he hanged himself, it will be
useless to try and shave him, for the hair will
grow as fast as it is taken off.”</p>

<p>“But that is impossible,” answered the archbishop;
“for we do not even know where the
good saint was baptized; and as for the soap
last used by the arch-traitor, I should not be
astonished to hear that Satan had taken it away
with him when he came to fetch Judas. No,
good Pedro; you must help me out of this
difficulty in some other manner.”</p>

<p>“Then we must do with St. James of Compostella
what the men of Burgos did with their
alcaide, who persisted in getting drunk when
he ought to have been getting sober. They got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>another alcaide as much like the other as possible,
excepting that he was not a <i>borracho</i>.
We must get another St. James like this one,
but without a beard, and the people will be
none the wiser.”</p>

<p>“But,” whispered the venerable archbishop,
“what are we to do without our real, own,
good, sweet St. James, whose miracles have
been the means of restoring so many erring
ones to the fold, and bringing in so much
money to the Church? How can we replace
him? And then, again, where can we hide
him?”</p>

<p>“All this can be arranged very easily,”
answered El Macho. “Any St. James will
perform the same miracles, for the people have
faith in him. It is the same with me; the
hidalgos have faith in me, and therefore believe
I am the only man in Compostella that can shave
them, although there are many other barbers.
It is the people’s faith that performs the
miracles. As for hiding the saint, I will put
him in a box I have got, and lock him up
safely.”</p>

<p>“Fair sir, I leave the matter in your hands,”
continued the archbishop; “but beware lest the
people get to hear of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>And having said this he mounted his mule
and rode off.</p>

<p>El Macho went in search of a sculptor, a
friend of his, and told him that he wanted an
image made exactly like that of St. Iago’s in
the cathedral, because he had made a vow that
should he live single up to the age of fifty, he
would endow his parish church in Cordova with
a St. James. He pressed his friend to make
haste, and told him he would pay him well for
his trouble.</p>

<p>At the end of ten days the image was
finished and handed over to the barber, who, in
the middle of the night, with the assistance of
the archbishop, entered the cathedral, took
down good St. James, disrobed him of his
armour, and having put it on the new St.
James, placed him on the altar, and then carried
the old image home.</p>

<p>Having locked the door, he proceeded to
place the saint in the wooden box, but found
out that his legs were too long; so he cut two
holes in the side, through which he allowed
them to project, and, putting down the lid,
locked it.</p>

<p>Next morning, after the first mass was over,
the people gave vent to their pleasure at seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>that St. James had a shaven face as formerly;
and the barber, who was at the door, gained
great praise by informing them that he had
been the unworthy means of shaving their
saintly patron.</p>

<p>Now, the saint, who heard this from his box,
commenced to hit about him, and shouted
out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good people, I am St. James with the
beard. El Macho is a villain!”</p>

<p>But the people laughed, thinking it was the
apprentice who was in the alcova, or inner
room, and had not got over the previous
night’s drinking. So they went their way,
laughing at the idea of a beardless boy thinking
he was good St. James with the beard.</p>

<p>Matters went on very well with regard to
the new St. James, who was not deficient in
working such miracles as the people liked to
ascribe to him and to believe of him. The
belted knights were pleased to find out that the
growing of a beard was only a passing fancy of
their patron; and as all were satisfied, and the
revenues increased, the priests were also well
pleased.</p>

<p>Good St. James had been confined within his
box for about three months when the day for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>his annual procession came round, and great
preparations had been made for the occasion.
Each knight had sent his war-horse fully caparisoned,
led by two servants in the livery of the
family, and followed by his shield and spear-bearers.
There were about one hundred and
fifty such chargers which preceded the horse
bearing the image of St. James, who was kept
secure in the saddle by a knight walking on
each side, holding his legs, while another one
followed bearing his banner. Then came the
standard-bearers of the knights, each with a
page richly dressed, and then came the archbishop
under the pallio, surrounded by the
dignitaries of the cathedral and minor priests of
the neighbouring villages. All the holy brotherhoods
presented themselves in their different
coloured robes, with their gold and silver
crosses, their richly emblazoned banners; and
in their midst walked little girls dressed up to
imitate angels, while the little boys swung
censers of burning incense. In the rear came
twelve squadrons of cavalry, four batteries of
artillery, and five brigades of infantry, which
had arrived from different garrison towns to
take part in the procession. From every
window scarlet damask drapery hung, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>as from the balconies where the lovely daughters
of Spain in all their holiday grandeur appeared,
fanning themselves gracefully&mdash;which
art they have cultivated to the detriment of
conversation, which to them is still an art little
attended to.</p>

<p>The streets through which the procession
had to pass were strewn with flowers, especially
fleurs-de-lis, and crowds had congregated on
the pavements.</p>

<p>El Macho had given his apprentice a half-holiday,
and was standing outside his house,
speaking to some customers, when he suddenly
heard a great noise, and turning round he saw
that good St. James in the box was running
towards the cathedral from which the procession
was emerging. Peals of laughter and
shouts of “El cajon” (“The box”) were taken
up by the multitude; but, fortunately for El
Macho, they did not see from which house the
box on legs had come.</p>

<p>Not waiting for admittance, and knocking
over the sentries at the door, the saint in the
box made straight for the archbishop, who,
knowing what it was, quietly walked into the
vestry, followed by St. James, and locked the
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Then he undid the box, and beheld good St.
James with a three months’ beard on his chin,
who shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>“Have me shaved, good archbishop! Let
me take my place in this grand cavalcade, and
I promise not to grow a beard again.”</p>

<p>The archbishop enjoined silence; and calling
for one of his acolytes, he ordered him to stop
the procession for half an hour, to have the
horse carrying the other St. James led into the
enclosed yard, and send for the barber, El
Macho. This having been done, the barber
was ordered to shave the saint and put on his
armour, which the other one was wearing. This
did not take long; but even so the people
wondered at what had happened, which, however,
they were never to know&mdash;not even the
mystery of this box on legs&mdash;because the archbishop
issued a pastoral granting plenary absolution
to all such as should not ask him any
questions, and excommunication to all such as
should find out.</p>

<p>Once again on horseback, and surrounded by
his faithful knights, St. James received the
homage of the vulgar crowds and of the lovely
ladies, and returned to his old place on the
altar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>That he did not relish being locked up in
the box for three months is proved by the fact
that when, on three or four occasions, his vanity
got the better of him, and the archbishop
thought he saw signs of letting his beard grow,
it was quite sufficient to show him the big box
for him to withdraw the obnoxious bristles.</p>

<p>The new St. James was presented to the
parish church at Cordova by El Macho, and
his vow having been thus accomplished, he
married the archbishop’s niece, gave up business,
and died shortly after.</p>

<h2><a name="Elvira_the_Sainted_Princess" id="Elvira_the_Sainted_Princess"></a><i>ELVIRA, THE SAINTED PRINCESS.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>amba</span> was king of the Goths, who
inhabited the northern part of Lusitania.
He was one of the bravest kings that ever
reigned, and the walls of his palace still stand
as evidence of the skill with which he studied
to improve his capital. But although he was
wise, he was not a good man, and his bravery
in war was not tempered by mercy. Like all
his predecessors, he was cruel to his victims,
and was more feared than loved.</p>

<p>Wamba had but one daughter, Elvira, whose
mother was a princess of the Moorish family
reigning in Andalusia. She was so beautiful
and so good, that she contributed in no small
degree in rendering her father’s reign famous.
Her long hair was of a lovely glossy black; her
eyes, of the same dark hue, had all the softness
of her race, and it was this very tenderness of
look that gave majesty to her appearance.</p>

<p>In those days there were but very few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Christians in Europe. The Crescent of the
false prophet had overcome for a time the
Cross of the true Saviour. To the teachings
of an old man, who in secret worshipped the
true God, Elvira owed the first lessons she got
of Christianity; and once the good seed was
sown, it multiplied.</p>

<p>Wamba did not know that his daughter was
a Christian; but he knew that she was very
good, and that for her goodness she was very
much beloved by all his subjects.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that in the dungeon of
his palace there were many prisoners condemned
to death by starvation, and it perplexed the
king to know how it was that they continued
to live. Every morning he would ask of the
gaoler if the prisoners had died, and the answer
was that they seemed quite well.</p>

<p>So one day he hid in a nook of the staircase,
hoping to find out who fed his prisoners. He
had not long to wait, for he soon saw Elvira
descending, followed by a young courtier,
Alaric, and carrying something in her apron.</p>

<p>Elvira, unknown to her father, had been in
the custom of carrying bread to the poor
prisoners, and she was assisted in her work of
mercy by her lover Alaric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>When she got close to the king, he started
out of his hiding-place, and seizing her by the
arm, she, in her fright, let fall her apron, out
of which fell beautiful roses, into which the
bread had been transformed.</p>

<p>Great was the surprise of the king, for he
thought she was carrying victuals. Then, in
his rage, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Elvira, thou art in league with the evil
one, and thou and thy lover shall die!”</p>

<p>Elvira and Alaric were themselves so astonished
at what had taken place, that they could
not speak, and allowed themselves to be led
away to separate gaols without offering an
explanation.</p>

<p>Wamba had it proclaimed that next day his
daughter Elvira and her lover Alaric would be
burnt in the public square for having dealings
with the evil one. Many of his oldest courtiers
tried to persuade him that he was too precipitate;
but he was not to be moved, and all that night
Elvira and Alaric were preparing to meet
death.</p>

<p>At the first ray of light Wamba was up, and
with his soldiers and executioners hurried to
the public square. Elvira and Alaric were led
among a strong body of men, and everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>was being prepared for burning the lovers, when
Elvira’s old tutor presented himself before
Wamba, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Know, O king, that thy daughter fears not
death, for her comfort is on the Cross, and not
on the Crescent. If any one be to blame, I am
he, for I instructed her. Let me, then, be
burned in her stead.”</p>

<p>Wamba gazed fiercely at the old man, and,
raising his massive olive staff surmounted by a
gold crown, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thou shalt also die, but not before thou
hast witnessed her sufferings. Thy God is a
false God, or if He have power to save all of
you, He shall cause this ancient olive staff to
grow and throw out green leaves by to-morrow
morning, or else you shall all die;” and saying
this, he stuck his royal staff into the ground.</p>

<p>Elvira was to be allowed to remain close to
the staff, but no one with her; and, so that she
might not escape, guards were posted all round
the square.</p>

<p>Kneeling at the side of that emblem of
authority, which for generations had been
wielded by her ancestors, she gave vent to her
prayers and tears, and the latter fell so quickly
that they moistened the ground; and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>morning came, Wamba, on arriving, saw his
royal staff growing, a sapling then, but shortly
to grow into a tree, even as the Christian faith
in its sapling stage was to throw out its
spreading branches over the kingdom, till they
all became one people, loving but one God.</p>

<p>Wamba caused a church to be built near the
spot, which church still exists; and the olive-tree
grows by its side, giving the name of
Olive-tree to the Square.</p>

<p>Alaric was married to Elvira; and Wamba
having been called to the grave of his forefathers,
these two reigned conjointly, and
appointed the old tutor their counsellor.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Enchanted_Mule" id="The_Enchanted_Mule"></a><i>THE ENCHANTED MULE.</i></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was once a very merry, but very
poor hostler in Salamanca. He was so
poor that he had to go about his business in
rags; and one day when he was attending on
the richly caparisoned mule belonging to the
Archbishop of Toledo, he gave vent to his
feelings in words.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said he, “my father was always called
a donkey from the day of his marriage; but
would to goodness I were the archbishop’s
mule! Look at the rich livery he bears; look
at his stout sides; see how he drinks up his
wine and eats his maize bread! Oh, it would be
a merry life, indeed! My father was, they say,
an ass, so I would be a mule!”</p>

<p>And then he leant against the manger, and
laughed so heartily that the archbishop’s mule
stopped eating to look at him.</p>

<p>“What ho!” said the mule. “Remember that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>my reverend master, being a corpulent man, is
somewhat heavy; but if thou wilt change conditions
with me, thou need but take hold of
both my ears, and, <i>caramba</i>, a mule thou shalt
be, and that in the service of the Archbishop
of Toledo!”</p>

<p>“And that will I,” answered Pablo the hostler;
“for better be a well-fed mule than a starving
hostler.” So saying, he seized the mule by the
ears, and, looking at him in the face, he was
immediately transformed; but, to his surprise,
he saw that the quondam mule was changed into
a monk. “How now!” cried he. “Wilt thou
not bring me some more wine and maize bread,
sir monk? Wilt thou not be my hostler?”</p>

<p>But the monk turned away and left the stable,
and Pablo then saw that he had made a mistake.
But he resolved that as soon as he was led out
into the street he would run off to his old mother,
and implore her to intercede on his behalf with
the patron St. James of Compostella.</p>

<p>When the archbishop had rested, he called
for his mule, which was brought out; and, in the
absence of the hostler, whom they could not
find, one of the attendants was about tightening
the girths, when the mule Pablo, seizing the
opportunity, bolted away as hard as he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>down the road in the direction of his mother’s
house.</p>

<p>The archbishop thought his mule had gone
mad, and as the servants followed it, running,
and crying out, “Stop the beast&mdash;stop it!” the
rabble joined in the chase; but Pablo never
stopped till he got to his mother’s house.</p>

<p>The old woman was at the door, spinning at
her distaff, and as she was very deaf she had
not heard the clamour. Pablo, bending over
her, tried to kiss her hand, to ask her for her
blessing, but his tongue now failed him. So
frightened was she at the approach of the
animal that she hit him over the head with her
distaff, and cried out, “Abernuncio!”</p>

<p>By this time the servants had surrounded
him, and were trying to lead him back, but he
would not go. He stood on his hind-legs, and
then lay down on his side, and rolled in the
dust till the scarlet saddle-cloth was spoilt, and
then, suddenly rising, rushed into the cottage,
and tried to sit on his accustomed chair.</p>

<p>His mother fled the house, and the rabble
entered, and so cudgelled Pablo that he was
fain to return to the inn; and, after being
groomed, he allowed the archbishop to mount
him. However, he had not gone far before he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>exclaimed, “By St. Iago, this mule hath the
pace of a camel!” Pablo, not being accustomed
to four legs, did not know how to use them, so
that he would move his right fore and hind
legs together. This caused the archbishop
great inconvenience, for, being a corpulent man,
it made him roll about on the saddle like the
gold ball on the cathedral of Sevilla, when the
west wind loosened it, and the east wind blew
it down.</p>

<p>Seizing the pommel with both his hands, and
raising himself in his shoe stirrups, he looked as
if he intended to vault over the head of the
mule; and as they were at this moment going
through a village, the inhabitants, who had
come out to see the archbishop, thought he
was about to deliver a sermon. So, surrounding
the mule, they uncovered their heads, and
knelt awaiting the blessing.</p>

<p>Pablo, forgetting he was a mule, thought the
people were doing homage to him, and being
of a merry disposition, he gave way to such
inward laughter that it brought on a violent fit
of coughing, which the faithful&mdash;not seeing the
face of the archbishop, for they devoutly bent
their heads towards the ground&mdash;took to be the
natural clearing of the throat before speaking.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>But the archbishop, who was now becoming
seriously frightened, and thinking that the evil
one had entered the body of his mule, exclaimed,
“Exorciso te&mdash;abernuncio!” Then did
Pablo sit down on his hind-quarters, so that the
archbishop slid off the saddle and rolled on the
ground, and another “Abernuncio!” in a deeper
tone, brought the devout people to their feet.
Pablo at this moment got up, and by so
doing completely capsized the venerable archbishop,
causing him to turn over on to his head.
Full of dust and anger, the prelate started to
his feet, and carefully examined his mule to see
if he could account for this peculiar behaviour.
Sorely grieved did Pablo feel at having caused
the good archbishop so much annoyance, and,
so as to show his contrition, he went down
on his fore-legs, thinking to kneel, which so
frightened all the people that they instinctively
took shelter behind the archbishop. But he
was as much afraid as the rest, and had it not
been that they held him by his robes, he would
have run away.</p>

<p>“This beats the mule of Merida,” cried one,
“who ran away with the miller’s wife and then
regretted the bargain. See, he is craving for
pardon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>Pablo the mule rose after kneeling for some
time, and, after the fashion of trained animals
of this breed, he extended his fore and hind-legs,
so as to facilitate the archbishop mounting
him, which he soon did, feeling convinced that
the mule had intended no harm; but Pablo,
regretting his mistake and the loss of time it
had caused, set off at a quick amble, which so
disconcerted his rider that he had to hold on
by the pommel and the crupper; and thus he
was hurried out of the village, and the people
were done out of the blessing.</p>

<p>The attendants, who were on foot, tried to
keep up with Pablo; but this they could not do,
owing to his long strides; and not until they
were within sight of Toledo did they get up to
their master, who, by this time, was out of
breath and countenance. They, fearing that
the mule might start off again, placed a man
on each side holding the reins, and thus did
they approach the eastern gate of the city, at
which many priests were waiting with the cross
and the sword of the archbishop, in order to
give him a fitting welcome, according to the
rules of the Church. Pablo, seeing the large
silver cross, the emblem of Christianity, slackened
his pace, and when within a few yards of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>it, in obedience to what his mother had taught
him as a child, dropped down on his knees,
bending his head to the ground; but this he
did so suddenly, that the archbishop fell off the
saddle on to his neck, and, to break his fall,
caught hold of his servants by their ears, nearly
tearing them off, and causing them also to
tumble. Thinking that the evil one had seized
them, they struck out right and left, and nearly
stunned their master with the blows and kicks.
Pablo, hoping to retrieve his fortune, started to
his legs with the archbishop clinging round his
neck, and galloped after the two servants with
his mouth open, so that, should he catch them,
he might bite them. But they, surmising what
he meant, sought refuge among the priests, and
these in their turn made haste to get into a
small chapel close by.</p>

<p>“Our archbishop must have changed mules
with Beelzebub,” said a fat priest, “for no
earthly animal would thus treat a prince of the
Church!”</p>

<p>“Ay,” continued one of the runaway servants;
“and if his neck had been a foot longer I should
have been dangling in mid-air like the coffin of
the false prophet.”</p>

<p>“I never thought to have run so fast again,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>ejaculated a very short and stout priest. “Faith,
my legs seemed to grow under me, as our
sacristan said after he had been tossed by the
abbot’s bull.”</p>

<p>“But what has become of the archbishop?”
said another. “We must not leave him in his
sorry plight.”</p>

<p>Saying this, he carefully opened the door of
the chapel, and there they saw their prelate
swooning on the pavement, and Pablo dashing
full tilt among the crowd, trying to wreak his
vengeance on as many as he could possibly get
hold of.</p>

<p>Having torn the leather breeches of some
half-dozen sightseers, and knocked down and
trampled on some score of men and women,
he rushed out of the city by the same gate, and
never stopped till he arrived at the inn where
he had been hostler. The master of the inn,
thinking that some mishap had befallen the
archbishop, made haste to secure the mule; but
as it was already night, he postponed sending
off one of his servants till next morning.</p>

<p>Once again at the manger, Pablo had time
to consider over the mistake he had made, and he
would gladly have undergone any punishment,
could he but have regained his former shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>While he was thus musing, he saw the monk
approaching, looking very sorrowful indeed.</p>

<p>“Pablo,” said he, “how dost thou like being
a mule?”</p>

<p>Now, Pablo was cunning, and, not wishing to
let the monk know what had happened, he
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>“As for liking it, I enjoyed carrying the
archbishop as much as he liked being carried;
but I am not accustomed to such gay trappings
and good living, so that I am afraid of injuring
my health.”</p>

<p>“If that be the case,” continued the monk,
“hold down thy head, and I will relieve thee
of the danger; for, to tell you the truth, I find
out that my wife is still living, and she recognized
me although I was disguised as a monk.
By my faith, I would rather bear my master’s
harness to the grave than my wife’s tongue
from morning till night! <i>Caramba</i>, I hear her
knocking at the door! Dear Pablo, let us again
exchange conditions.”</p>

<p>And Pablo, when he awoke next morning,
was tightly grasping a beam, thinking he was
the Archbishop of Toledo clinging on to the
mule’s neck.</p>

<p class="book"><span class="title">KENSINGTON:</span> PICTURESQUE AND
HISTORICAL. By <span class="smcap">W. J. Loftie</span>, B.A., F.S.A., Author of
“A History of London,” &amp;c., &amp;c. Illustrated by <span class="smcap">W. Luker, Jun.</span>,
from Original Drawings carefully finished on the spot and engraved in
Paris. LONDON: Field &amp; Tuer, The Leadenhall Press, E.C. £2 5s.</p>

<p>Since the publication of Faulkner’s work in 1820, no history
of Kensington pretending to accuracy or completeness has been
produced. This sumptuous work contains full and descriptive
accounts of the parish of Kensington and the adjoining
Palace and Gardens, with the changes and improvements of the
past half century or more; notices of Kensington celebrities and
of the great national institutions which have sprung up at
Kensington Gore and Brompton Park; and a fund of discursive
matter of local and historical interest. In regard to the very
numerous and absolutely faithful illustrations, two years have
been spent by the artist in making for this work original drawings
of old and modern Kensington. They include artistic exteriors
and interiors; glimpses of Kensington Gardens; the Palace in
which the Queen was born; the park; the people, streets,
houses, churches, and ruins; and pretty, quaint, and taking
“bits” of Kensington scenery. All the drawings have been
engraved in Paris in the finest possible manner, and the paper
on which they are printed has been specially manufactured of a
quality to ensure the delicacy of the originals being fully
retained.</p>

<p>For the curious a few PROOF copies of <span class="smcap">KENSINGTON:
Picturesque and Historical</span> at five guineas, bound in full
morocco, have painted in water-colours on the front, under the
gilt edges of the leaves, a couple of Kensington views, which,
until the leaves are bent back at an angle, are invisible.</p>

is about 7-1/2 × 8-3/4 in., and the price is only that usually charged for common
scribbling paper. <span class="smcap">The Author’s Paper Pad</span> may be comfortably
used, whether at the desk, held in the hand, or resting on the knee. As
being most convenient for both author and compositor, the paper is
ruled the narrow way, and of course on one side only.&mdash;<i>Sixpence each,
5/- per dozen, ruled or plain.</i></p>
